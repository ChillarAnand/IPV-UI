International Classification => (71) 
Abstract => In a mounting structure of a vehicle body cover and a seat lock 
for a scooter-type vehicle, a box section having front, rear, left, and right walls in 
formed of a cover hinge 33 at the portion which swings together with a rear cover 
34, a seat catch 85 is stored in the box section, the seat catch engages a seat hook 
extending from the lower surface of the rear portion of a seat 23, and a seat catch 
operating rod 86 extending from the seat catch is supported by the rear wall. 
 
An integral structure is achieved by storing the seat catch in the hinge bracket of 
the cover hinge.  A trouble of assembling the seat catch can be eliminated.  Since 
the seat catch is stored in the box section, the seat catch can be prevented from 
being tampered.
