Abstract => An apparatus is described, for making 
a glass preform by flame hydrolysis. The apparatus 
includes a main deposition burner configured to direct 
two or more streams of soot-forming reactants and a 
stream of flame gases into a deposition chamber, in a 
direction toward a rotating support mandrel, so as to 
form by flame hydrolysis a glass preform on the 
mandrel. One or more pairs of auxiliary burners may 
also be included, for introducing further streams of flame 
gases, but no streams of soot-forming reactants, toward 
the glass preform, from opposite lateral sides of the 
main deposition burner; to provide additional heat when 
the preform has reached a predetermined size, thereby 
improving efficiency. The main deposition burner is 
configured to direct the two or more of the streams of 
soot-forming reactants to impinge quasi-tangentially 
toward the mandrel and, further, to direct the stream of 
flame gases obliquely inwardly toward the two or more 
streams of soot-forming reactants, to narrow the flame's 
width along one or both of two orthogonal axes.
