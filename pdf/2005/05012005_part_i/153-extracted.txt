Abstract => Microcellular elastomers and a process for making them are disclosed.  The process 
comprises reacting a resin component (“B” side) with an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer (“A” side).  
Pre-reacting the right proportion of chain extender into an “A” side that also includes a high-primary, 
low-unsaturation polyol is the key to making low-density (less than 0.5 g/cm3) microcellular elastomers 
while avoiding problems with poor processing or inferior physical properties.  The process is easy to 
practice, and provides lighter, high-quality polyurethane products, including protective sports equipment, 
arm rests or steering wheels for the auto industry, and midsoles or shoe soles for footwear.
