Title => NICKEL MIXED HYDROXIDE, METHOD FOR THE 
PRODUCING THE SAME, AND THE USE THEREOF AS  
A CATHODE MATERIAL IN ALKALINE BATTERIES. 
 

International Classification => H 01 M 4/52 (71) 
Abstract => The invention relates to a nickel mixed hydroxide, comprising Ni as a primary element and 
having a layer structure comprising at least one element Ma which is selected from the group Fe, Cr, Co, Ti, 
Zr and Cu, and which exists in two different oxidation levels that, with regard to the number of outer 
electrons, differ by one electron.  The inventive nickel mixed hydroxide also comprises; at least one element 
Mb which is present in the trivalent oxidation level and which is selected from the group B, Al, Ga, In and 
SE (rare-earth metals); optionally comprises at least one element Mc which is present in a bivalent oxidation 
level and which is selected from the group Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn; comprises, in addition to the hydroxide, 
at least one additional anion selected from the group halogenides, carbonate, sulfate, oxalate, acetate, borate 
and phosphate in a quantity which is sufficient to ensure the electroneutrality of the mixed hydroxide; and 
comprising hydration water in a quantity which stabilizes the respective structure of the mixed hydroxide.  
The inventive nickel-mixed hydroxide is produced by coprecipitating the hydroxide in a alkaline medium.  
The inventive nickel mixed hydroxide are characterized by a very high electrochemical utilization of the 
nickel ions, high capacitances with regard to mass, and a very good cycle stability and, as a result, are 
advantageously suited as cathode material in alkaline batteries.
