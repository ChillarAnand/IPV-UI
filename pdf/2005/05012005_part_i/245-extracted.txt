Title => VACUUM CLEANER. 
 

International Classification => A 47 L 5/28 (71) 
Abstract => The invention provides a vacuum cleaner (10) having a 
chassis (12), supporting wheels (14) mounted on the 
chassis (12), drive means (15) connected to the 
supporting wheels (14) for driving the supporting 
wheels (14) and a control mechanism for controlling 
the drive means (15) so as to guide the vacuum cleaner 
(10) across a surface to be cleaned. A cleaner head (22) 
having a dirty air inlet (24) facing the surface to be 
cleaned is mounted on the chassis (12) and separating 
apparatus (52) is supported by the chassis (12) and 
communicates with the cleaner head (22) for separating 
dirt and dust from an airflow entering the vacuum 
cleaner (10) by way of the dirty air inlet (24). The 
separating apparatus (52) comprises at least one 
cyclone (54, 56). This type of separating apparatus is 
not prone to clogging and therefore the pick-up 
capability of the cleaner (10) is maintained at a high 
standard.
