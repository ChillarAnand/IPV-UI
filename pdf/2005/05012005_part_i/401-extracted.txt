Abstract => There is provided a zeolite bound seolite catalyst which does not contain significant amount of non-
zeolitic binder and can be tailored to optimize its performance and a process for converting hydrocarbons utilizing the 
zeolite bound zeolite catalyst.  The zeolite bound zeolite catalyst comprises core crystals containing first crystals of a first 
zeolite and optionally second crystals of a second seolite having a composition, structure type, or both that is different 
from said first zeolite and binder crystals containing third crystals of third zeolite and optionally fourth crystals of a fourth 
zeolite having a composition, structure type, or both that is different from said third zeolite.  If the core crystals do not 
contain the second crystals of the second zeolite, then the binder crystals must contain the fourth crystals of the fourth 
zeolite.  The zeolite bound zeolite finds application in hydrocarbon conversion processes, e.g., catalytic cracking, 
alkylation, disproportional of toluene, isomerization, and transalkylation reactions.
