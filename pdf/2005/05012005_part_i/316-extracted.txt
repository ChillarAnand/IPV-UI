Abstract => An improved process for making pigmented, microcellular polyurethane elastomers by reacting a 
resin component and an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer is disclosed. The resin component 
includes a polyol and two chain extenders, one of which is 1,3-propanediol or a branched C3-C5 diol.  
The chain extender combination enables successful elastomer processing throughout a broad range 
(at least a 50C) of molding temperatures and surprisingly overcomes pigment-induced problems with 
processability and physical properties.  The process is ideal for making polyurethane shoe soles and 
midsoles.
