Title => USE OF SUBSTITUTED 4-BIARYLBUTYRIC ACID  
5-BIARYLPENTANOIC ACID DERIVATIVES AS MATRIX 
METALLOPROTEASE INHIBITORS FOR THE 
TREATMENT OF RESPIRATORY DISEASES. 
 

International Classification => C 07 C 59/88 (71) 
Abstract => Novel 4-Biarylbutyric and 5-Biarylpentanoic Acid Derivatives, use of substituted 4-Biarylbutyric and 5-
Biarylpentanoic Acid Derivatives as Matrix Metalloprotease Inhibitors for the Treatment of Respiratory 
Diseases, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and a process for using them. The compounds of the 
invention have the generalized formula (I) (T)xA-B-D-E-CO2H wherein A is an aryl or heteroaryl rings; B is 
an aryl or heteroaryl ring or a bond; each T is a substituent group, x is 0, 1, or 2; the group D represents (a), 
(b), (c), or (d); the group E represents a two or three carbon chain bearing one to three substituent groups 
which are independent or are involved in ring formation, possible structures being shown in the text and 
claims; and each of the substituents on E is an independent substituent; and include pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts thereof.
