Abstract => A method of fabricating an optical waveguide 
fiber that includes the steps of providing a 
cylindrical glass optical fiber preform having a 
longitudinally extending centerline hole, and 
closing the hole under conditions suitable to result 
in uniform and symmetric hole closure. The 
method may include first plugging a first end and 
a second end of the centerline hole to prevent gas 
flow therethrough. The method preferably 
involves closing the centerline hole of the preform 
by drawing the preform down into an optical 
waveguide fiber.
