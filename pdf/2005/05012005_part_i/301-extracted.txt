Abstract => A method for enhancing the photosensitivity of glasses useful 
in forming waveguides, where the waveguide material 
exhibits persistent UV photosensitivity after diffusion of 
hydrogen or deuterium out of the waveguide material. An 
optical waveguide fiber (22), with a cladding layer (26) and a 
portion of the polymeric coating (28) removed, has a core 
(24) which has been loaded with hydrogen or deuterium to 
form a waveguide core (24) with an associated baseline 
refractive index. At least a portion of the exposed fiber 
waveguide is exposed to UV radiation (32) to induce a 
change in the refractive index and then annealed to diffuse the 
hydrogen or deuterium gas out and stabilize the refractive 
index change. The resulting waveguide fiber retains sufficient 
UV sensitivity to allow further changes in the refractive 
index, such as grating formation. This process is useful in 
fabricating grating devices, modifying or tuning gratings for 
optimum strength or wavelength characteristics and providing 
accurate spatial control of waveguide sensitivity.
