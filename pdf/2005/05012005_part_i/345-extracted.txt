Abstract => This invention provides a foam-dispensing 
packet which comprises a sealed pouch having at least 
one flexible wall, the pouch comprising an interior 
chamber and a channel for dispensing foam from the 
interior chamber. A sponge is disposed within the 
chamber as well as a foamable fluid. When intermittent 
pressure is applied against the pouch wall, thereby 
squeezing the sponge, foam is released from the 
opened packet.
