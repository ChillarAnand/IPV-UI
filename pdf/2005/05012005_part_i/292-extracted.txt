Title => A MULTIMODE FIBER AND METHOD FOR FORMING IT 
 

International Classification => G 02 B 6/10 (71) 
Abstract => A multimode optical fiber (10) having a first laser 
bandwidth greater than 220MHz.km in the 850nm 
window, a second laser bandwidth greater than 
500MHz.km in the 850nm window, and a second 
OFL bandwidth of at least 500MHz.km in the 
300nm window is disclosed. The multimode fiber 
is capable of operating telecommunication systems 
employing both LED power sources and high 
power laser sources. Method of making and testing 
the multimode optical fiber are also disclosed.
