Abstract => A process for producing terephthalic acid and/or dimethyl rerephthalate includes 
contacting a toluene-containing reaction stream with a first catalyst under toluene disproportionation 
conditions to produce an intermediate product stream of para-xylene with negligible ortho-xylene.  The 
first catalyst includes a crystalline molecular sieve which has an ortho-xylene diffusion rate of at least 50 
minutes.  The first catalyst can be modified by selectivation with a silicon compound or carbon 
compound.  The intermediate product strea, without need for para-xylene purification, is oxidized to 
terephthalic acid or dimethyl terephthalate.
