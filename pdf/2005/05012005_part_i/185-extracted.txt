Title => SPECIALLY SHAPED MULTILAYER ARMOR 
 

International Classification => F 41 H 1/00 (71) 
Abstract => Armor, in particular body armor for female wearers is 
made of multiple layers (30) of penetration-resistant 
material for example made of polyaramid fibers, 
specially shaped to fit over a shaped area to be 
protected, e.g., the bust of a female wearer. The 
armor's shaped part is held in shape by a series of darts 
(37) in successive layers (30) of the material. Each dart 
in a material layer comprises a generally V-shaped 
section (35) whose edges (37) are joined to form the 
dart. The V-shaped section (35) of the material is 
folded on itself to form a pleat (40) which is folded 
over to one side of the dart (37) to form an added 
thickness overlaying or underlying an adjacent part of 
the material (30). The darts (37) are angularly offset 
from one another with the pleats (40) oriented in 
directions so that the added thickness is distributed 
substantially evenly, thereby avoiding bulges or 
stiffness and improving the wearing comfort. 
Preferably, the layers of material are fabric covered 
over selected areas thereof to be protected with a 
bonded or coated reinforcing film, except in the folded 
V-shaped sections.
