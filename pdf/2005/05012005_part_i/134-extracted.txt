Title => RANDOM ISOMONOOLEFIN/ ALLYL STYRENE COPOLYMERS AND  
                                       FUNCTIONALIZED DERIVATIVES THEREOF 
 

International Classification => C 08 F 210/10,  
Abstract => The invention provides a copolymer of an isomonoolefin  having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms and containing 
a copolymerized alkenyl styrene moiety represented by formula (I), where m = 0 – 2, n = 0 – 20, each of 
R1 through R7 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1 to C10 alkyl and C1 to 
C10 primary or secondary alkyl halides, and at least one of R1, R2 or R3 is hydrogen, and when m = 1 or 2, 
R3 and R1 are –CH2-.
