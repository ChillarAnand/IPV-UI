Abstract => A method whereby an aqueous slurry containing a water soluble polysaccharide thickener 
(carboxymethyl cellulose, natural rubber, etc.) can be prevented from putrefaction and a high storage 
stability over a long time can be imparted thereto.  This method comprises adding an alkali metal salt or 
zinc salt of 2-pyridinethiol-1-oxide optionally combined with a formaldehyde-liberating compound to an 
aqueous slurry containing a polysaccharide thickener.
