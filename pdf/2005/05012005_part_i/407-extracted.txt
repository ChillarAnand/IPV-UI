Abstract => The invention relates to a method of controlling an arrangement designed for generating cold air for 
cooling objects that are in need of being cooled, and an arrangement for carrying out the method. The arrangement 
includes a compressor (1) having air inlet means and compressed air outlet means, a heat exchanger (2) connected to the 
compressor outlet means via a first conduit (4) and functioning to cool the compressed air, a helical screw expander (3) 
which is connected to the heat exchanger (2) via a second conduit (5) and which includes an outlet for expanded and 
cooled air, and a third conduit (16) which extends from the outlet of said expander (3) to the object in need of being 
cooled. The method is characterised by sensing the temperature of air exiting from the expander (3) at a position in or 
downstream of the expander outlet, and by controlling the mass flow of air to the expander (3) in accordance with the 
temperature sensed. The arrangement for generating cold air for cooling objects that are in need of being cooled is 
characterised by a temperature sensor (11) positioned in the expander outlet or in the third conduit (6), and by a device (7, 
8, 9; 10) which is actuated by the temperature sensor (11) and which functions to adjusts the mass flow through the 
expander (3) in accordance with the temperature sensed.
