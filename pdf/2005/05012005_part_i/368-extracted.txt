Abstract => Genetic, biochemical, biophysical and anatomical information is integrated at the cellular and subcellular 
level.  At least one database containing biological information is used to generate at least one data 
structure having at least one attribute associated therewith. An interface interactively views and links 
together attributes of a plurality of data structures to create at least one hierarchical description of 
subcellular and cellular function.  A computational engine generates at least one mathematical equation 
from the hierarchical description.  Genetic information is accessed, tabulated and combined with 
functional information on the biochemical and physiological role of gene products.  Computational 
models of genetic, biochemical and biophysical processes within cells are automatically formulated, 
solved and analysed based on combination of genetic and functional information adduced.  A dynamic 
tool is thereby provided for achieving objectives, such as increased understanding of biological processes, 
identification of new drug targets for therapeutic intervention and prediction involving the outcome of 
drug screening.
