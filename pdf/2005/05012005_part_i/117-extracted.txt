Abstract => Apparatuses and methods for use in vacuum 
vapor deposition coating provide for simpler, economical 
and continuous operation. A system and method for 
continuously melting and evaporating a solid material for 
forming a coating vapor includes the use of a separate 
melting crucible and evaporating crucible. A system and 
method for energizing the evaporative solids to form a 
plasma which includes first and second electrodes and a 
device for selectively switching polarity between the first 
and second electrodes to avoid coating vapor deposition on 
the electrodes. Another system and method for energizing 
the evaporative solids to form a plasma which includes an 
electric arc discharge apparatus with a cathodic and an 
anodic part. A continuously fed electrode is disclosed for 
continuous vaporization of electrode members in an electric 
arc discharge. An apparatus and method provides for 
measurement of the rate of evaporation from an evaporator 
and the degree of ionization in a vapor deposition coating 
system. Lastly, a system is disclosed for in-situ cleaning of 
vaporizable deposits for cleaning of the enclosure of the 
vacuum vapor deposition system.
