Abstract => The present invention relates to a process for treating a mixture of a liquid oil and a copper 
chlorophyll extract with a mixture of at least 90% by weight of a C2-C4 alcohol, and water at a 
certain concentration.  The thus treated mixture is then suitable for making microcapsules with a 
green coloured liquid core material comprising said mixture by means of complex coacervation. 
These microcapsules can be included in oral care products to import a speckled appearance thereto.  
The liquid oil is typically sunflower oil or paraffin oil, and the C2-C4 alcohol is typically ethanol or 
isopropanol.
