Title => HYDROPHILIC AMPHOLYTIC POLYMER. 
 

International Classification => C 08 F 220/04 (71) 
Abstract => A novel hydrophilic ampholytic polymer synthesized by reacting polymerizable amino 
and carboxy functional ethylenically unsaturated monomers, together with a non-ionic hydrophilic 
monomer, to provide a polymer having a glass transition temperature (Tg) above 50ÂºC, and optionally 
hydrophobic monomer(s), and cross-linking monomer(s).  The copolymer is precipitated from a 
polymerization media which includes a suitable organic solvent.  The resulting copolymer is in the form of 
a fine powder, with submicron particle size.  As such it is suitable for use as a thickener or rheology 
modifier in personal care formulations, such as shampoo, conditioner, and the like, as a bioadhesive, and 
for other pharmaceutical applications.
