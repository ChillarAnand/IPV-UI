Abstract => A method for controlling the refractive index 
achieved using a fluorine dopant gas, wherein CF4 is 
employed as the dopant gas, and the soot preform 
(12) is doped using the CF4 for a time and 
temperature sufficient to result in a decrease in 
fluorine dopant nearest the surface which is in contact 
with the CF4 gas. Preform (12) is mounted on handle 
(11) which is fused to handle (14) and the assembly 
(20) is heated in a furnace muffle (15). The CF4 flows 
through furnace muffle (15), as indicated by arrows 
(17), and preferably contains a diluent gas such as 
helium. An optional centerflow gas (16) may be 
flowed through the centerline hole (18) in several 
embodiments, which consists of helium. The end of 
the porous preform (12) may optionally include a 
capillary tube (19) to prevent the muffle gases (17) 
from entering the preform.
