Title => FRICTIONAL ENGAGING DEVICE AND FRICTIONAL ENGAGEMENT CONTROL METHOD. 
 

International Classification => F 16 D 28/00 (71) 
Abstract => A frictional engaging device and frictional engagement 
control method, wherein with attention paid to the 
phenomenon of the frictional coefficient of the friction 
surfaces of a friction engagement device being changed 
when an electric field is applied to the friction surfaces, 
this phenomenon is utilized to control the transmittal 
force. Under the action of a pushing force, friction 
engagement members are brought into direct contact 
with each other for frictional engagement. When an 
electric field is applied between the frictional 
engagement members, the frictional coefficient of the 
friction surfaces changes, which means that the 
transmittal force can be changed. An example of the 
frictional engagement device is a clutch device (10). A 
friction member (20) made of insulation material is 
attached to an input disk (16) and engages an output disk 
(22). The friction surfaces are lubricated. A control 
device (30) controls a voltage applying device (28) and 
applies a voltage to an electrode (26) to provide a 
desired transmittal force.
