Abstract => A process for producing a thermoformed package comprises the steps of placing a first sheet of film 
over a forming die having at least one cavity, heating the film to mould the film into the at least one cavity thereby 
forming at least one recess in the film, placing a composition in the at least one formed recess; and sealing a 
second sheet of film across the at least one formed recess to produce at least one closed package. The film is 
heated by a heating plate having at least one concave depression which in use overlies the at least one cavity, 
wherein the heating step involves the step of bringing the film into intimate contact with the or each depression.
