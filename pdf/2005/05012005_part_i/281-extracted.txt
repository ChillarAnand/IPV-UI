Title => METHOD FOR HYDROGENATING AROMATIC POLYMERS IN THE  
                                       PRESENCE OF SPECIAL CATALYSTS 
 

International Classification => C 08 F 8/04, 8/00 (71) 
Abstract => A method for hydrogenating aromatic polymers in the presence of catalysts, whereby a metal or 
mixture of metals from sub-group VIII of the periodic table of elements is used together with an 
aluminium oxide support and the pore volume of the pore diameter of the catalyst ranges from 1000-
10000 A when measured according to quicksilver porosimetry, generally representing 100-15% in 
relation to the overall pore volume when measured according to posimetry.
