Abstract => An apparatus and method for sealing the top (preform 
entry end) of an optical waveguide fiber draw furnace 
is disclosed. The apparatus includes an assembly (10) 
constructed and arranged to removably cover the top of 
the draw furnace (60) while mating with the downfeed 
handle (28). The apparatus includes an elongated 
sleeve (12) having a base (16) and a sealing mechanism 
(18) positioned on the sleeve at a location remote from 
the base. The sleeve (12) defines a chamber (50) for 
receiving the downfeed handle (28), and the sealing 
mechanism (18) is arranged with respect to the sleeve 
to mate with the downfeed handle received in the 
chamber. In one aspect of the invention, the apparatus 
further includes an inert gas purge (22, 24, 26) for 
providing an inert atmosphere within the chamber (50). 
A method of sealing the top of an optical waveguide 
fiber draw furnace is also disclosed.
