Abstract => A filter comprises a first end (6), a second end (8), a conducting casing (4), at least one central conductor (16), and 
connecting means (3a, 3b) at each of the ends (6, 8), the casing (4) extending along an imaginary axis (A) and is 
intended to accommodate the conductor (16) along this imaginary axis (A), and further the conductor (16) is provided 
with capacitance generating portions (20, 24, 28, 32) and inductance generating portions (22, 26, 30), the connecting 
means (3a) at the first end (6) of the filter comprising a first connecting member (10) connected to the casing (4) and a 
second connecting member (17) connected to the conductor (16), the connecting means (3b) at the second end (8) of 
the filter comprising a third connecting member (13) connected to the casing (4) and a fourth connecting member (37) 
connected to the conductor (16). According to the invention both the second and the fourth connecting members (17, 
37) are provided integrally with the conductor (16).
