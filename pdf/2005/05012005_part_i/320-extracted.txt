Abstract => The system and method of the present disclosure 
provides an innovative technique and efficient 
hardware structure for recovering lost or damaged 
compression constants in the encoded domain. In 
one embodiment, a lost/damaged compression 
constant is recovered by estimating (110) a 
compression constant of the block using encoded 
data of at least one neighboring block of data and 
other recoverable compression constants of the 
block.
