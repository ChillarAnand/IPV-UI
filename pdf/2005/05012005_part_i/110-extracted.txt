Abstract => The method for fabricating an optical 
waveguide may include a plurality of mechanical steps, 
e.g., lapping, polishing, and/or dicing, and bonding steps, 
e.g., attaching with adhesives. In one embodiment, the 
method includes the steps of providing an optical material 
(20), thinning and polishing the optical material to form an 
optical waveguide core (12) comprising a plurality of 
longitudinally extending surfaces, providing a plurality of 
support substrates (30, 50, 90, 110), and attaching the 
plurality of support substrates to the longitudinally 
extending surfaces of the core (12). The plurality of support 
substrates may be attached to the plurality of longitudinally 
extending surfaces of the optical material with an adhesive. 
The optical material may include a high refractive index, 
and the plurality of support substrates and/or the adhesive 
may include a low refractive index.
