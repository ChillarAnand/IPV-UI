Abstract => A method and apparatus for enhancing 
the performance of a network by performing selective 
spoofing. Selective spoofing provides the ability to 
discriminate among different connections and only 
allocate spoofing resources to those connections for 
which spoofing will actually improve performance. The 
selective spoofing functison described are applicable to 
a wide variety of communication links, including both 
slow and fast links, high latency links, and links with low 
and high error rates. The selective spoofing functions 
may be implemented either alone or in combination with 
other performance enhancing features, such as, 
spoofing the conventional TCP three-way handshake, 
local data acknowledgement, multiplexing multiple 
connections across a single connection, data 
compression/encryption, prioritization, and path 
selection. The selective spoofing features described are 
particularly useful for links with high latency and/or high 
bit error rates.
