Title => ENERGY GAUGE 
 

International Classification => H 02 J 7/00, 
Abstract => An energy gauge for indicating 
the amount of residual power 
available from a battery includes 
means for storing a 
predetermined value of a power 
parameter indicative of full 
battery capacity, means for 
determining the instantaneous 
power consumption indicated by 
the parameter, means for 
integrating the power 
consumption indicative of the 
parameter since commencement 
of use of the battery, means for 
subtracting the integrated 
consumption from the stored 
value of full capacity to provide 
a value of power remaining, and 
readout means for providing a 
representation of the power 
remaining.
