Abstract => A process for the preparation of a monomer-grafted cross-linked polymer comprising the 
steps of: i) acticating the polymer by irradiation; ii) quenching the activated polymer so as to effect cross-
linking therein; iii) activating the cross-linked polymer by irradiation; iv) contacting the activated cross-
linked polymer with an emulsion which comprises: a) an unsaturated monomer; b) an unsaturated 
monomer; b) an emulsifier: and c) water, for a time sufficient to effect the desired of grafting.
