Abstract => Use of a more accurate, constant or quasi-constant 
reference signal-to-noise ratio value to support the 
process of decoding information sequences that 
have been encoded using turbo coding techniques, 
particularly in UMTS WCDMA receivers, enhances 
the accuracy of the decoding process and, in turn, 
link quality and overall system performance. This 
may be accomplished by exploiting the reference 
SNR, which is generated, for example, by the power 
control loop in the receiver. More specifically, the 
present invention modifies this reference SNR value 
based on various factors including, but not limited 
to, the scaling factor that is applied to the decoder 
input metrics, power settings, processing gains, 
coding rates and/or the modulation scheme.
