Abstract => A user terminal is operable to acquire 
service in a satellite mobile communication network in 
which plural service providers each communicate via 
satellite with users on one or more spotbeams each 
having a select frequency. The user terminal comprises a 
communication system including a transmitter and a 
receiver for communicating via a spotbeam. A memory 
stores frequency information. The frequency 
information identifies carrier frequencies associated 
with the spotbeams in the network. The memory further 
stores identification information identifying a service 
provider associated with each carrier frequency. A 
communication controller is operatively associated with 
the communication system and the memory for selecting 
a spotbeam carrier frequency to communicate on, the 
communication controller utilizing identification 
information to select the spotbeam carrier frequency.
