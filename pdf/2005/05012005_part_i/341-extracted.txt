Abstract => Pectin having a degree of blockiness of at least about 10 %, a degree of esterification of at least 
about 55 %, and a DELTA CS of no more than about 100 centipoise. A process for making a pectin, which includes 
the step of treating a starting pectin having a degree of blockiness of at least about 10 %, a degree of esterification 
of at least about 55 %, and a DELTA CS of greater than about 0 centipoise, with a pectin lyase under conditions 
sufficient to produce a processed pectin having a DELTA CS that is lower than the DELTA CS of the starting 
pectin. A comestible composition containing such a pectin, and a method of increasing the storage stability of a 
comestible composition by formulating the composition with such a pectin.
