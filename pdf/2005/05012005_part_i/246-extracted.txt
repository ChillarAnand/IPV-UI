Title => MATERIALS AND METHODS FOR THE MODIFICATION  
OF ISOPRENOID CONTENT, COMPOSITION AND 
METABOLISM. 
 

International Classification => C 12 N (71) 
Abstract => Novel isolated polynucleotides associated with plant isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways are 
provided, together with genetic constructs comprising such sequences.  Methods for the modulation of the 
content, structure and metabolism of polypeptides involved in an isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway in target 
organisms are also disclosed, the methods comprising incorporating one or more of the polynucleotides or 
genetic constructs of the present invention into the genome of a target organism.  Modulation of the content, 
structure and metabolism of such polypeptides produces modifications in the content, structure and 
metabolism of isoprenoids in the target organism.
