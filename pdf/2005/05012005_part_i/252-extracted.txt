Title => TRIBLOCK COPOLYMERS INCORPORATING A STYRENE/ISOOLEFIN COPOLYMER MIDBLOCK. 
 

International Classification => C 08 F 297/00 (71) 
Abstract => Novel triblock copolymers are provided.  The triblock copolymers have a midblock which is a 
copolymer of an isoolefin monomer and a vinyl aromatic monomer.  Preferably, the midblock is a copolymer 
of isobutylene and alkylstyrene.  The end blocks of the triblock copolymer are either a homopolymer of a 
vinyl aromatic monomer or a copolymer of two or more monomers selected from the group consisting of 
vinyl aromatics, styene, methylstyrene, butylstyrene, halostyrene, p-allylstyrene and p-3-butenylstyrene.  In 
addition, a process is provided for preparing a triblock copolymer.  The process involves: a) initiating a 
“living” polymerization of an isoolefin monomer (monomer A) and a first vinyl aromatic monomer (monomer 
B) in a reaction vessel using carbocationic polymerization conditions and a catalyst capable of 
carbocationically polymerizing monomer A and monomer B; b) allowing the polymerization to continue for a 
period of time T1, during which additional monomer A and/or monomer B may be optionally added; c) at the 
completion of time T1, continuing the polymerization by adding only additional monomer A for a period of 
time T2; d) at the completion of time T2, continuing the polymerization by adding a second vinyl aromatic 
monomer (monomer C) for a period of time T3; e) at the completion of time T3; quenching the 
polymerization; and f) recovering a triblock copolymer.
