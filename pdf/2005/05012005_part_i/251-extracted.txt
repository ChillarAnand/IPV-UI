Title => DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING PHENOL OXIDIZING ENZYMES. 
 

International Classification => C 12 N 15/53 (71) 
Abstract => Disclosed herein are detergent compositions comprising novel phenol oxidizing enzymes 
encoded by nucleic acid capable of hybridizing to the nucleic acid having the sequence as shown in SEQ 
ID NO: 1 and in particular those obtainable from fungus, in particular from Bipolaris spicifera, Curvularia 
pallescens and Amerosporium atrum.  The present invention provides expression vectors and host cells 
comprising nucleic acid encoding phenol oxidizing enzymes, methods for producing the phenol oxidizing 
enzyme as well as methods for constructing expression osts.
