Abstract => Apparatus and a process for providing oxygen and hydrogen at a desired minimum pressure from an 
electrolyser comprising an anolyte solution having an anolyte liquid level; a catholyte solution having a catholyte liquid 
level; oxygen generated at an oxygen pressure above said anolyte; hydrogen generated at a hydrogen pressure above said 
catholyte for passage through hydrogen outlet means; the method comprising raising the oxygen pressure above the 
anolyte to effect a positive liquid level pressure differential between said catholyte level and said anolyte level to a pre-
selected value to effect closure of said hydrogen outlet means and an increase in the hydrogen pressure to a value to effect 
opening of said hydrogen outlet means to provide hydrogen at said desired minimum pressure.  The hydrogen is provided 
on demand at a readily available pressure suitable for use, such as in the case of hydrogen in metal hydride production or 
supply to a compressor for subsequent higher pressure utility; and oxygen for breathing assistance and sanitization 
purposes.  The pressure differential across the cell membrane is low or negligible, notwithstanding the hydrogen and 
oxygen product pressure.
