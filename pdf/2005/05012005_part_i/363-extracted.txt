Abstract => This invention relates to methods of replacing water and 
cyclohexanone with acetic acid in an aqueous solution of 
catalyst, preferably a cobalt compound. Such an aqueous 
solution is produced by extracting catalyst with water from a 
cyclohexanone/water solution of reaction products made by 
the direct oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid. The 
replacement of both water and cyclohexanone are conducted 
in a solvent exchange column, wherein acetic acid dissolves 
the catalyst, while water vapors force the cyclohexanone into 
a condenser, followed by a decanter wherein two liquid 
phases may be formed and separated; an upper liquid phase 
containing a majority of cyclohexanone and a lower liquid 
phase containing a majority of water. The cyclohexanone 
may be removed in a pre-treatment zone, wherein also part of 
the water may be removed, before the concentrated catalyst 
extract enters the solvent exchange column.
