Title => USE OF CIC TO IDENTIFY CALLS WHEN USING ISUP IN  
                                       CONJUNCTION WITH AAL TYPE 2 SIGNALING PROTOCOL 
 

International Classification => H 04 Q 11/00 (71) 
Abstract => In an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) based transmission network, call control signaling 
information associated with a first telecommunications signaling protocol, such as an N-ISDN 
system 7 signaling protocol, is bound to bearer control signaling information associated with a 
Q.aal2 signaling protocol, where both call control signaling information and bearer control signaling 
information are required to set-up and maintain an ATM network connection. Binding the call 
control signaling information and the bearer control signaling information is accomplished as a 
function of the circuit identification code associated with the call control signaling information, 
where the circuit identification code is transferred from the N-ISDN system 7 signaling protocol to 
the Q.aal2 signaling protocol. The call control signaling information and the bearer control signaling 
information are then independently transported from a source node in the transmission network to a 
destination node, over an ATM/ATM adaptation layer type 5 transmission link, in accordance with 
the ISUP system 7 signaling protocol and the Q.aal2 signaling protocol respectively. At the 
destination node, the call control signaling information and the bearer control signaling information 
are aligned as a function of the circuit identification code, and an ATM network connection is 
established.
