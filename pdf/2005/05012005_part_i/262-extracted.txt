Title => METHOD IN A TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM 
 

International Classification => H 04 B 7/005 (71) 
Abstract => The present invention relates to a method for downlink 
power control in the base station of a code division 
multiple access (CDMA) communication system. The 
total assigned downlink power from the base station is 
adjusted to a maximum downlink power level by means 
of individually adjusting the assigned bit rates of an 
appropriately selected subset of downlink channels to 
those users having a data communication connection. 
Said subset is retrieved by applying suitable selection 
criterions for the downlink channel, e.g., the 
momentarily assigned bit rate, the reported pathloss, or 
the user subscription type.
