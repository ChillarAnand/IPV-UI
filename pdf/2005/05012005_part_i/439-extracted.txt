Abstract => A method suitable for detecting the onset of 
colloid formation within a solution whose composition is in a 
state of change, which method makes use of the technique of 
acoustophoresis and which comprises the steps of either (I) 
applying an oscillating electric field to the solution and 
monitoring the amplitude of the resultant acoustic signal, the 
onset of colloid formation being detected by a change in the 
amplitude of the resultant acoustic signal, or (ii) applying an 
oscillating acoustic signal to the solution and monitoring the 
resultant oscillating electric field, the onset of colloid formation 
being detected by a change in the amplitude of the resultant 
oscillating electric field, or (iii) applying an oscillating electric 
field to the solution and monitoring the resultant oscillating 
electric field, the onset of colloid formation being detected by a 
change in the amplitude of the resultant oscillating electric 
field.
