Abstract => An apparatus and method of forming filament circuit 
patterns with planar and non-planar portions and interconnection cards, 
smart cards or optical fiber circuit cards formed therefrom are provided. A 
filament circuit path is scribed by moving a filament guide and a substrate 
relative to one another, and dispensing a filament on, or in the vicinity of, a 
surface of the substrate. The filament or the substrate or both have adhesive 
surface(s). The adhesive surface is capable of being adhesively actuated by 
application of energy. Energy is applied simultaneous with, or subsequent 
to, scribing. A portion of the filament circuit pattern is planar and another 
portion is non-planar. The non-planar portion traverses but does not contact 
or adhere to a pre-selected area of the substrate. The pre-selected area 
corresponds with a pad, a contact pattern, a hole, a slot, a raised feature, a 
part of the previously scribed planar portion of the pattern, and a filament 
termination point. Alternately, the non-planar portion may be embedded 
below the surface of the substrate. Another planar portion of the filament 
circuit traverses the non-planar portion but does not contact or adhere to a 
pre-selected part of the previously scribed non-planar portion. According to 
the above method wire-scribed circuit boards are formed including 
interconnection cards, smart cards or optical fiber circuit cards.
