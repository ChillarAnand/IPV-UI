Abstract => The present invention relates to a composition for 
coating an optical fiber (10) that comprises a core 
fiber (12), a cladding (14), a inner primary coating 
(16), and an outer primary coating (18). Wherein the 
composition of the present invention contains an 
oligomer capable of being polymerized, a monomer 
suitable to control viscosity of the composition, and 
an adhesion promoter which includes a compound 
containing a cyclic structure interposed between at 
least two reactive silanes which are independently an 
alkoxysilane or a halosilane. Another composition of 
the present invention includes an oligomer capable of 
being polymerized, a monomer suitable to control 
viscosity of the composition, an adhesion promoter 
which includes a compound containing a reactive 
silane group, and a carrier. The present invention also 
relates to optical fibers and methods of making optical 
fibers using the composition of the present invention.
