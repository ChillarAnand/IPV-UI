Abstract => A system and method for improving quality assurance, 
imparting many person-months of time and cost 
savings, and streamlining the product development 
process of target device utilizing commercially 
available operating systems, such as Windows CE, 
includes a testing device which applies a suite of 
comprehensive validation test programs. This system 
and method, an O/S Validator (1), provides a fully 
automated design verification package for 
commercially available operating systems (1000a), 
Windows CE, by utilizing a host graphical user 
interface harness (12), a host to target communications 
(3), at least one test suite (11), and a result capture 
methodology (12). The O/S Validator (1) provides a 
faster and more accurate automated test suite 
technology for testing a port of a commercially 
available operating systems (1000a), such as Windows 
CE, to target hardware (1000, 9). In addition, O/S 
Validator (1) includes a comprehensive code-base 
developed specifically to purposefully stress the 
operating system O/S, device driver, OEM Adaptation 
Layer (OAL), 
  
 
 
 
 
and hardware interaction. The test suites (11) 
focus on identifying three primary defects 
including hardware design, hardware 
programming (drivers/OAL), and operating 
system interaction. Special diagnostic emphasis 
is placed on operating subsystems which have 
historically demonstrated the most problems.
