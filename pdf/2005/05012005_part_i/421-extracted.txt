Abstract => A block key for ciphering block data by using 
ATS added depending on the arrival time of a transport packet 
constituting a transport stream is created. Since the ATS is 
random data depending on the time, a unique key different with 
block can be created, thereby enhancing the strength against 
cipher analysis. The block key is created by combining the ATS 
and keys unique to the device and the recording medium such 
as the master key, disk unique key, and title unique key. Since 
the block key is created using the ATS, no areas on the 
recording medium for storage of a ciphering key for each block 
is required.
