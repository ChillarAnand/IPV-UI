Abstract => A radial conduit coupling (36) is 
provided. The conduit coupling (36) may include a 
tubular first connector (40) having an exterior diameter 
(50), an interior diameter (52) and first (54) and second 
(56) ends. The first end (54) may be adapted to receive a 
first conduit (34). The second end (56) may include at 
least one locking lug (89) configured to cooperate with 
at least one shaped cavity associated with a component 
of a conduit system. The locking lug (89) may extend 
from at least one tab lock (80) disposed at the second 
end of the first connector (40). In one embodiment, a 
protrusion (58) may extend from the interior diameter 
and generally separate the first end (54) from the second 
end (56). The protrusion (58) may include an interior 
diameter which generally corresponds to the interior 
diameter of the first conduit (34). A sealing surface (84) 
may be disposed between the protrusion and the locking 
lug (89), and the sealing surface (84) may be configured 
to cooperate with the second sealing surface (94) 
associated with a second connector to form a generally 
fluid tight seal between the first connector (40) and the 
second connector (42).
