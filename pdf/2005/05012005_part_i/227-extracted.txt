Title => OPTICAL FIBER SPOOL PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE INNER END  
                                       OF THE WOUND OPTICAL FIBER 
 

International Classification => B 65 H 75/14, 
Abstract => An optical fiber shipping spool (22), winding 
system and method for allowing automated 
winding of an accessible lead meter portion of 
optical fiber onto the spool (22). The spool 
comprises primary and lead meter barrels (24, 28) 
separated by an outboard flange (26). The outboard 
flange (26) has a slot (32) extending to its 
periphery, the slot (32) providing a path for fiber 
between the lead meter and primary barrels, the slot 
(32) having an inlet facing the lead meter barrel 
(28) and an outlet facing the primary barrel (24). 
The slot (32) is angled such that when fiber being 
wound onto the lead meter barrel (28) comes into 
contact with the slot inlet, the fiber is automatically 
drawn into the slot (32) and then guided by the slot 
(32) onto the primary barrel (24). According to 
another aspect, a high-strength rib configuration is 
disclosed including a plurality of curved, 
intersecting ribs (90) formed on a flange (26D) of 
the spool
