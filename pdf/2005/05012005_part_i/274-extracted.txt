Title => METHOD FOR PREPARING METHYL CARBAZATE 
 

International Classification => C 07 C 281/02 (71) 
Abstract => Especially pure methyl carbazate with a particularly low tendency to discoloration is obtained from 
hydrazine and dimethyl carbonate by simultaneous addition of the two reactants to a first solvent at 
between â€“20 and +30 0C, removal of the solvent and light-boiling components by distillation at 
reduced pressure, and either addition of a second solvent to the resulting crude methyl carbazate and 
removal of said solvent by distillation or passing of an inert gas through said crude methyl carbazate.
