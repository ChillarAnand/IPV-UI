Abstract => A command packet (C2) including a version 
command for checking a profile is sent from a 
data transmitter (STB) to a data receiver 
(printer), and a response packet (R2) including 
the resulting profile information is sent from 
the data receiver to the data transmitter. The 
data transmitter sends the data receiver a data 
packet (S2) including the image data 
corresponding to the profile information. Thus, 
a controller can quickly check the state of a 
device to be controlled.
