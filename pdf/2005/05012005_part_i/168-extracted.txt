Abstract => A tuneable laser that includes a gain 
section (11; 34) and a tuneable wavelength-
selective filter (12; 27). The invention is 
characterised in that a reflection filter in the form of 
an external reflector (13) is adapted to give a 
number of fixed reflection maxima, where each 
maximum corresponds to a given wavelength. The 
reflection filter is adapted to coact with the tuneable 
filter and the laser is adapted to be tuned to lase at 
any selected one of said wavelengths, by tuning the 
tuneable filter (12; 27). The invention also relates 
to a method.
