Title => CHANGEOVER VALVE 
 

International Classification => A 47 L 5/32, 
Abstract => A changeover valve (100) comprises a first valve member (20) and a second valve member (50). The first 
valve member (20) has an aperture (28). The second valve member (50) has first and second apertures (54, 
58). The first valve member (20) is movable relative to the second valve member (50) for selective 
alignment of the first valve member aperture (28) with one or other of the apertures (54, 58) of the second 
valve member (50). The valve (100) also has a ramp and follower means (29, 62) for automatically moving 
the valve members (20, 50) away from the one another during changeover movement of the first valve 
member (20) relative to the second valve member (50) so that wear on the surfaces of the valve members 
(20, 50) is minimised.
