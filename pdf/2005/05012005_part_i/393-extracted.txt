Abstract => The invention relates to a method for producing ABS and HIPS molding materials. According to 
this method, a solution containing rubber is produced first and the polymerization for producing the ABS and 
HIPS molding materials is then carried out in the presence of this solution containing rubber. The solution 
containing rubber is produced by polymerizing diolefines in a solution of vinyl aromatic monomers, in the 
presence of a catalyst containing the following: (A) at least one compound of the rare earth metals; (B) 
optionally, a cyclopentadine; and (C) at least one organo-aluminium compound.
