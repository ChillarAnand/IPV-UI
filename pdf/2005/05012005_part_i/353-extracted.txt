Abstract => Disclosed is a dispersion compensating optical fiber that 
includes a core surrounded by a cladding layer of 
refractive index nCL. The core includes at least three 
radially adjacent regions, a central core region, a moat 
region having a refractive index nM that is sufficiently 
lower than nCL such that DELTA M </= -0.4 %, and a 
ring region. As the ring region exhibits sufficiently high 
refractive index at a sufficiently long distance from the 
outer edge of the moat region, the fiber can exhibit low 
values of negative dispersion slope at low values of 
negative dispersion and yet exhibit good bending loss. 
This ring region is also capable of imparting to the fiber 
a relatively high cutoff wavelength, so that the present 
invention is particularly well suited for use in L-band 
systems. A particularly suitable fiber has an index 
profile in which that part of the ring region at the 
transition between the moat and the ring region has a 
refractive index such that its delta value is close to zero. 
Also disclosed is a method of forming the fiber of the 
present invention.
