An aqueous agrochemical composition comprises an agrochemical active ingredient such as glyphosate, 
paraquat or fomesafen and an adjuvant of formula (I): X-(R3O)a-R4-N R2R1 and salts thereof, wherein R1 
and R2 are independently hydrogen or a lower alkyl group or a group X-(R3O)a-R4- wherein X is -OH or a 
lower alkoxy group; R3O is an ethoxy, propoxy or butoxy group or a random or block mixture thereof; R4 
is a linear or branched chain alkylene bridging group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; X is (IA) -OH 
or a lower alkyloxy group; or (IB) a group R5R6N- or R5R6N-R7-; or (IC) a group (1) wherein a, is from 1 
to 400 or if X is of formula IC, the sum of a, b and c is from 3 to 400 and d is 0 or 1.
