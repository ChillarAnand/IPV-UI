Abstract => The invention relates to the control of the 
movement of a sliding or swinging and sliding door (1) in its end 
closing area (x). The door leaf (82) can always move in the 
direction of closing by means of a free wheel (8) or similar but 
can only move in the direction of opening when a brake, 
coupling (9) or other fixing device for the part of the free wheel 
(8) that is located further away from the door leaf is released. A 
device for determining the position of the door is also provided. 
The invention is characterised in that any conventional anti-
jamming measures that might be provided in the predetermined 
end closing area (x) are deactivated, in that as long as the door 
leaf (2) is located in the end closing area, the power to the door 
drive (4) and therefore, the closing force exerted on the door 
leaf, is reduced and in that the brake, coupling (9) or similar 
acting on part of the free wheel (8) that is located further away 
from the door leaf is released. The invention also relates to 
embodiments of this basic idea.
