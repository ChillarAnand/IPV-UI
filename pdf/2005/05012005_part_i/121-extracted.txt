Abstract => An optical system (20) projects light into a planar 
optical display (10). The display includes 
laminated optical waveguides (12) defining an 
inlet face (14) at one end and an outlet screen (16) 
at an opposite end. A first mirror (26) collimates 
light from a light source (18) along a first axis, 
and distributes the light along a second axis. A 
second mirror (28) collimates the light from the 
first mirror along the second axis to illuminate the 
inlet face and produce an image on the screen.
