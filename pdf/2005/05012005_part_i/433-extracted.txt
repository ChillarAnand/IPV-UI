Abstract => A method for reducing catalyst attrition losses in hydrocarbon synthesis processes conducted in high 
agitation reaction systems; a method of producing an attrition-resistant catalyst; a catalyst produced by such method; a 
method of producing an attrition-resistant catalyst support; and a catalyst support produced by such method.  The
