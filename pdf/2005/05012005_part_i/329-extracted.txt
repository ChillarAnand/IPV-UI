Abstract => A process for producing a thermoformed package comprises the steps of placing a first sheet of film over 
a forming die having at least one cavity, heating the film to mould the film into the at least one cavity thereby 
forming at least one recess in the film, placing a composition in the at least one formed recess, and sealing a 
second sheet of film across the at least one formed recess to produce at least one closed package. Once formed, 
the or each recess is substantially retained in its formed orientation by the application of a vacuum through the or 
each cavity.
