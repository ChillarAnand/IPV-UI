Title => APPARATUS FOR PLAYING A GAME 
 

International Classification => G 07 F 17/34 (71) 
Abstract => The apparatus (10) has a payment acceptor (30, 31) for receiving 
payment of a stake from a player of the game. The apparatus (10) 
has a plurality of randomisers (60, 70) each of which can 
generate a random combination of indicia from a set of available 
indicia. The apparatus (10) has activating means (54) for 
activating the randomisers (60, 70) and comparator means for 
determining a winning combination of indicia. The apparatus 
(10) has payment means (90) for awarding a winning payment to 
a winning player of the game. The activating means (54) in every 
turn of play activates all of the randomisers (60, 70) and in every 
turn of play each randomiser generates a random combination of 
indicia. Each of the randomisers (60, 70) comprises a set of 
rotatable mechanical reels. The randomisers (60, 70) operate 
independently of each other such that the chances of one 
randomiser (60, 70) generating a particular set of indicia are 
completely unaffected by the indicia generated by any other 
randomiser.
