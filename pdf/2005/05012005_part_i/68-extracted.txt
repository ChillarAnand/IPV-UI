Title => IMPROVED DETERGENT COMPOSITION AND PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE. 
 

International Classification => (71) 
Abstract => The invention relates to an active/benefit agent delivery system of particulate sub-micron 
zinc oxide (ZnO) and its process of manufacture.  The invention provides for an active/benefit agent 
delivery system of particulate zinc oxide comprising ZnO particulates of size less than  1  micron wherein 
the said particulates of  ZnO are obtained or molecular species of zinc preferably in the presence of surface 
active agents. 
 
The invention further provides for a process for the manufacture of the active/benefit agent delivery 
system of particulate zinc oxide of particle size less than  1 micron comprising: 
 
- generating the molecular species of zinc in an alkaline phase; 
 
- neutralizing the said alkaline molecular zinc phase with an acid in the presence of surface 
active agents; and 
 
- generating nanoparticles by polymerization of the molecular zinc by reduction in pH.
