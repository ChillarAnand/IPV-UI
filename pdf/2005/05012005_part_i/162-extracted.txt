Abstract => The present invention relates to a testing 
device for detecting and determining material 
inhomogeneities in electrically conductive samples (10), 
comprising a support (30) for the samples(10) to be 
tested, a temperature regulating device (30, 50, 60) for 
configuring a temperature profile in the sample (10), a 
drive connected to the support (30) for changing the 
position of the sample (10) and at least one measuring 
sensor (20) for contactless measurement of the magnetic 
field outside the sample (10).
