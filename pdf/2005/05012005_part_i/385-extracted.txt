Abstract => An apparatus for controlled hydration and 
continuous full absorption cooking of a bed of particulate food 
product, said apparatus comprising a substantially horizontal 
vessel (12) in which said hydration and cooking process takes 
place, having an inlet end (14) and an inlet port (16) for 
introducing food product into said vessel, an outlet end (18) and 
an outlet port (20) for the discharge of the food product, an upper 
portion (22), and at least one trough portion (24); loading means 
(38) for introducing food product into said vessel; conveying 
means (30) for moving food product from said inlet end to said 
outlet end of said vessel during said hydration and cooking 
process; hydration means (47) for hydration and cooking the food 
product during the transit by said conveying means from said 
inlet end to said outlet end of said vessel, said hydration means 
delivering water to the surfaces of the food product so that the 
food product is exposed to water at substantially its rate of
