Title => TITANIUM ADDITIVES FOR MANGANESE DIOXIDE CATHODE  
                                       ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL 
 

International Classification => H 01 M 4/50, 6/06 (71) 
Abstract => A cathode (12) that includes manganese dioxide 
and a titanium oxy salt, preferably titanium oxy 
sulfate, is disclosed. Batteries (10) having 
cathode (12) have good performance 
characteristics. For example, the batteries (10) 
perform well in applications involving 
intermittent drains such as toys. Also disclosed is 
an electrochemical cell including a cathode (12) 
an anode (14) and a separator (16) disposed 
between the cathode and the anode. The cathode 
includes manganese dioxide and a titanium oxy 
salt.
