Title => POROUS POLYMETHYLSILSESQUIOXANE WITH ADSORBENT PROPERTIES. 
 

International Classification => C 08 G 77/06 (71) 
Abstract => The invention concerns a porous polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMS) having a specific surface area ranging 
between about 50 and 500 m2/g, a porous volume ranging between about 0.1 and 0.8 cm3/g, a monolayer 
volume ranging between about 10 and 60 cm3/g, a pore radius less than 1 mn of 90% of the pores and 
insoluble in water and organic solvents. The inventive PMS is prepared by precipitating a 
polymethylsiliconate of general formula (I) wherein n is an integer between about 20 and 100 and M is 
alkaline or alkaline-earth metal or NH4+.
