Abstract => A flow-frame for forming a sub-
assembly; said sub-assembly comprising a bipolar 
electrode and an ion-selective membrane mounted 
on said flow-frame and wherein said sub-assembly 
may be stacked together with other such sub-
assemblies to create an array of electrochemical 
cells; wherein said flow-frame is formed from an 
electrically insulating material and comprises at 
least four manifold-defining portions which also 
define pathways for the passage of the 
anolyte/catholyte. Such pathway may define a 
labyrinthine path which may be spiral in shape 
betweeen the manifold and the chamber entry/exit 
port.
