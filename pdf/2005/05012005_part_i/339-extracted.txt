Abstract => The invention relates to a method of 
pre-clinical and clinical diagnosis of transmissible 
spongiform encephalopathies, characterised in that the 
altered expression of a marker protein is measured. In 
particular embodiments, in the method according to the 
invention, the marker protein measured is the prion 
protein PrP-sen or interferon gamma (IFN gamma ), or 
the laminin receptor (LR) or the laminin receptor 
precursor (LRP). The invention also relates to a test kit 
using antibodies specific to the marker protein according 
to the invention. The invention further relates to a test kit 
using oligonucleotides which are capable of hybridising 
under stringent conditions with the nucleic acid coding 
for the marker protein according to the invention. The 
invention further relates to the use of antibodies or 
oligonucleotides which are specific for the above-
mentioned marker proteins in a method according to the 
invention. The invention further relates to the use of the 
test kit for diagnosing transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathies.
