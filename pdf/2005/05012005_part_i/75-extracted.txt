Title => METHODS OF SEPARATING CATALYST IN SOLUTION FROM A  
                                       REACTION MIXTURE PRODUCED BY OXIDATION OF  
                                       CYCLOHEXANE TO ADIPIC ACID 
 

International Classification => C 07 C 51/31,  
Abstract => This invention  relates to methods of controlling the oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid in the 
presence of a monobasic acid solvent by separating the catalyst from the reaction mixture, outside 
the reaction zone. Substantially all the unreacted cyclohexane, the majority of adipic acid, and 
substantially all the monobasic acid solvent are preferably removed. A protic solvent, may be added 
intermittently or continuously in the reaction mixture during the removal of the monobasic acid
