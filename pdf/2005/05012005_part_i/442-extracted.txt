Abstract => An automatic seaming machine for joining by weaving two opposed fabric ends.  The machine 
comprising an end selector (50) driven by an end selector drive for selecting a free warp yarn and an inserter means 
(70) driven by an inserter means drive for pulling the yarn thus selected through the shed to join the ends together.  A 
fault detector monitors the selection of the yarn by the end selector (50), and an inserter pick-up detector monitors the 
engagement and pulling of the yarn by the inserter means (70), such that if a fault occurs in either the selection or 
engagement/pulling the respective fault detector and inserter pick-up detector sends a fault signal to a central control 
means which in turn then sends a stop signal to the end selector drive and the inserter means drive in order to bring the 
machine to a complete halt and thereby terminate the weaving process.
