Title => METHOD AND APPARATUS USING ATTENUATION OF RADIATION  
                                       TO DETERMINE CONCENTRATION OF MATERIAL IN OBJECT 
 

International Classification => G 01 N 23/02,  
Abstract => An apparatus for determining dopant 
concentration in soot that constitutes at least a 
portion of a soot preform used to form an optical 
waveguide includes a weight-measuring device, 
a thickness-parameter-measuring device, a 
radiation source, a radiation sensor, and a 
determination device. The weight-measuring 
device measures the weight of the soot preform. 
The thickness-parameter-measuring-device 
measures a thickness parameter of the soot 
preform. The radiation source irradiates the soot 
with penetrating radiation. The radiation sensor 
detects intensity of penetrating radiation passing 
through the soot. The determination device 
determines a concentration of dopant in the soot 
based on the detected intensity of penetrating 
radiation and the measured weight and thickness 
parameter.
