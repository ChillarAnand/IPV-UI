Abstract => A content key, an authentication key, program 
data along with an effective key block (EKB) are transmitted by 
an encryption key structure of a tree structure. The EKB has a 
structure in which a device constituting a tree leaf holds a leaf 
key and a limited node key. A specific effective key block 
(EKB) is generated and distributed to a group specified by a 
specific node, thus limiting an updateable device. A device not 
belonging to a group cannot be decoded, ensuring the 
distribution security of the key and so forth. Keys or data is 
distributed by an encryption key structure of tree structure, 
thereby providing an information processing system and 
method capable of efficiently and safely distributing data.
