core of a magnetizable material and a winding 
(8). The rotor rotates in relation to the stator 
with one degree of freedom. The stator 
comprises a cup-shaped cavity (9) surrounding 
the rotor. The cavity is limited by a rotational 
surface which is formed by a line which 
rotates around an axis and where the line is 
partly arched.
