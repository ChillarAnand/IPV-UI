Abstract => A continuous process for the manufacture of impact resistant polymers is disclosed. The process 
comprises polymerization of a reaction mixture containing vinylaromatic monomers in the presence of soluble 
rubber and entails shearing at least some of said mixture at a rate of more than 30 000 1/s using a device having 
no rotating parts. The resulting product is characterized in its low gloss and improved impact properties.
