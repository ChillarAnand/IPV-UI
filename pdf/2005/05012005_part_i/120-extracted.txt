Abstract => Fabrics are cleaned by treating at least a 
portion of the piece of fabric with a particulating 
chemical, and agitated by a gas jet of a particle-
dislodging gas to dislodge the particulated soil. The 
particulating chemical loosens embedded non-
particulate soil and converts it to a particulate form, 
which is then seperated from the fabric by the particle-
dislodging gas.
