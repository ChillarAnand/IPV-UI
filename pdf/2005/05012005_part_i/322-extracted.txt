Abstract => A novel process for producing homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene which involves contacting 
ethylene and at least one or more olefin comonomer(s) under polymerization conditions with a 
Ziegler-Natta type catalyst substantially free of internal election donor, trimethylaluminum and at 
least one compound containing at least one carbon-oxygen-carbon linkage (C-O-C) of the formula 
R1-O(-R2-O)n-R3 where n ranges from 0 to 30, and R1, R2 and R3 independently contain from 1 to 30 
carbon atoms and from 0 to 30 heteroatoms of an element, or mixtures thereof, selected from Groups 
13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 of the Periodic Table of Elements, and further wherein R1, R2 and/or R3 can be 
linked and form part of a cyclic or polycyclic structure. Also provided are films and articles 
produced therefrom.
