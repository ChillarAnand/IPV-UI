Abstract => A method for the production of clavulanic acid by the fermentation of a clavulanic acid 
producing microorganism at a controlled level of at least 50 mg/l ammonia has been provided for.  Under 
the application of these reaction conditions surprisingly high production levels of clavulanic acid have 
been obtained.
