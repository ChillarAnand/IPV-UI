Abstract => Disclosed is an apparatus for measuring the 
properties of an optical waveguide fiber. The 
apparatus is free of apertures, lenses, and 
mirrors usually required in the measurement of 
certain waveguide fiber properties. The 
apparatus employs an optical switch at the 
launch end of the optical fiber to be tested and 
another optical switch at the output end of the 
optical fiber to be tested. The switches 
preserve the mode power distribution, 
particularly the spot size, of light passing 
therethrough. The apparatus may be used to 
measure bandwidth or attenuation of a 
multimode waveguide fiber, both of which are 
affected by launched and detected mode power 
distribution.
