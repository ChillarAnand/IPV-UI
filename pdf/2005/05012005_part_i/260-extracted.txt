Title => IMPROVED IN VIVO PRODUCTION OF CEPHALOSPORINS. 
 

International Classification => C 12 P 35/00 (71) 
Abstract => The present invention discloses a process for the production of 7-ACA or a derivative 
thereof comprising the steps of fermenting a P. chrysogenum strain being transformed with an expression 
construct comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding expandase, hydroxylase and acetyltransferase activity 
in the presence of a suitable acyl side chain precursor, or a salt or ester thereof, such that an N-acylated 7-
ACA compound is produced.  N-deacylating the thus produced N-acylated 7-ACA compound and, 
optionally, acylating the free amino group and/or substituting the 3â€™ acetate group with a side chain suitable 
to form a cephalosporin antibiotic, characterised in that the nucleotide sequence encoding the 
acetyltransferase is derived from Acremonium chrysogenum and starts at the second ATG of the open 
reading frame as present in said nucleotide sequence.
