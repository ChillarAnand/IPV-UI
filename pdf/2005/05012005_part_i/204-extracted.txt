Title => MATERIALS AND METHODS FOR THE MODIFICATION OF PLANT  
                                       CELL WALL POLYSACCHARIDES 
 

International Classification => C  12 N  (71) 
Abstract => Novel isolated polynucleotides and polypeptides associated with the synthesis of plant cell wall 
polysaccharides are provided, together with genetic constructs comprising such sequences.  Methods 
for using such constructs for the modulation of polysaccharide content in plants are also disclosed, 
together with transgenic plants comprising such constructs.
