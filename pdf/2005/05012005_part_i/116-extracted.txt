Abstract => The present invention provides libraries of tag dominant-negative elements (TDNE) and 
methods enabling the identification of specific TDNEs that act as dominant-negative elements on a target 
protein of interest.  The present invention further relates to the use of such TDNEs and dominant-negative 
elements for the identification of protein-protein interactions, and the determination of a target protein’s 
biological activity and function.  Furthermore, the present invention relates to the development of means, 
including small molecule compounds, for disrupting the target protein’s biological function and activity.
