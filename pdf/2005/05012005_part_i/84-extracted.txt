Title => SWITCHING POWER SUPPLY CIRCUIT 
 

International Classification => H 02 M 3/338,  
Abstract => A switching power supply circuit is 
disclosed which allows selective use of 
a switching element having a 
comparatively low voltage 
withstanding property and a low 
current capacity and can be produced 
in a low lost and with a small size. 
Upon starting of power supply, the 
switching frequency of the switching 
element is raised by a soft starting 
circuit to increase a period of time until 
a secondary side DC output voltage 
reaches a steady level thereof. As a 
result, the levels of a resonance voltage 
and a collector current obtained when 
the switching element starts its 
switching operation are suppressed.
