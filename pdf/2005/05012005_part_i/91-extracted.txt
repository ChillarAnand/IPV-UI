Title => FLAME-RETARDANT RESIN COMPOSITIONS 
 

International Classification => C 08 L 101/00,  
Abstract => A novel flame-retardant resin composition comprising: (A) 100 parts by weight of a thermoplastic 
resin which is not a thermotropic liquid-crystal polymer; (B) 0.01 to 50 parts by weight of a 
thermotropic liquid-crystal polymer; and (C) 1 to 30 parts by weight of a nonhalogenated 
phosphazene compound.  The composition is free from any problem caused by the use of a 
halogenated compound, is excellent in flame retardancy, mechanical properties, moldability, etc., 
and is less apt to drip.
