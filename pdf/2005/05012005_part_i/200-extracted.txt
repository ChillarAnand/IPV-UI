International Classification => C 07 F 9/38,  
Abstract => The invention relates to organophosphorous compounds of general formula (I) wherein A 
corresponds to general formula (II), wherein one or more of the carbon atoms, selected from the 
group C3, C4, C5 and their respective substituents can be omitted, and at least one substituent of B1 to 
B10 is a C3-8 cycloalkyl C0-9 alkyl group, wherein both the C3-8 cycloalkyl group and the C0-9 alkyl 
group can have one or more double bonds and one or two carbon atoms of the cycloalkyl group can 
be substituted by nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atoms, and wherein both the cycloalkyl group and the 
alkyl group can be substituted by hydrogen, halogen amine, oxo groups with branched or unbranched 
C1-9 alkyl groups and C2-9 alkenyl groups, wherein the C1-9 alkyl groups and C2-9 alkenyl groups can 
be substituted by hydrogen, hydroxy, amine, halogen, and oxo groups. The invention further relates 
to pharmaceutical preparations containing said compounds and to the use thereof for the therapy and 
prophylaxis of infectious processes in humans and animals, which processes are induced by bacteria, 
fungi or parasites. The inventive compounds are also used as fungicidal, bactericidal or herbicidal 
agents in plants.
