Abstract => An electronic device having a circuit 
board, a shielding plate disposed thereon and a three-
terminal regulator is provided with a heat sink positioned 
on the outer side of the circuit board and connected to 
the three-terminal regulator. The heat of three-terminal 
regulator is radiated from the heat sink, thus making it 
possible to prevent heating of the shielding plate. In this 
way, electronic device elements that do not stand up 
very well to heat, such as an optical pickup unit, can be 
placed directly on shielding plate, so that the heat of 
three-terminal regulator is efficiently dissipated and the 
size of the electronic devices may be reduced.
