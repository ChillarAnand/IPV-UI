Title => NON-CONTACT OR NON-CONTACT HYBRID SMART CARD FOR  
                                       LIMITING RISKS OF FRAUD 
 

International Classification => G 06 K 19/077 (71) 
Abstract => The invention concerns a non-contact or a non-
contact hybrid smart card, comprising an antenna on 
a support, said antenna consisting of at least a turn 
made of electrically conductive ink screen printed on 
the support, two card body elements (24) on either 
side of the support, each of the card body elements 
consisting of at least a plastic layer, and a chip or a 
module (26) connected to the antenna. The support is 
made of paper and bears cutouts (22) at each corner 
whereat are welded together the two card body 
elements, thereby enabling it, when the card is 
subjected to folding, to become delaminated at the 
site where stress loads have been generated by 
folding, which provides evidence, a posteriori, of a 
voluntary damaging act, the card preserving the 
folding trace, and thus provides a countermeasure 
against fraud.
