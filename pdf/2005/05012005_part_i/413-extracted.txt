Abstract => The invention relates to a multi-stage method for producing gas-filed microcapsules.  In one stage of the 
method, the substance that forms the coat is polymerized.  The microcapsules are formed in a physically and/or 
temporally separate stage, by means of a structuring process.  The polymerization is carried out with moderate stirring, 
while the microcapsules are structured in dispersing conditions.
