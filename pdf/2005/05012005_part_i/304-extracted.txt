(57) Abstract: 
An apparatus and method for sealing the bottom of an optical 
waveguide draw furnace is disclosed. The apparatus includes 
an assembly (10) constructed and arranged to mate with the 
bottom (70) of the draw furnace (51) to form a seal, and a 
leak detection system communicating with the assembly to 
signal the forming of a proper or an improper seal. The 
covering plate (12) of the assembly is selectively seated on 
the sealing plate (72) of the draw furnace (51) to form the 
seal, and an inert gas is delivered between the covering plate 
(12) and the bottom (70) of the draw furnace. The flow of the 
inert gas is detected to determine if the seal has been 
properly formed. An assembly (10) including a covering 
plate (12) having at least two radially spaced gaskets (18, 20) 
circumferentially positioned on the top surface (14) of the 
covering plate (12) for engagement with the sealing plate 
(72) at the bottom (70) of the draw furnace

method for sealing the bottom of a draw furnace are also 
disclosed. Sealing the bottom of sucha draw furnace occurs 
during preform loading and unloading as well as during idle 
periods, i.e. those periods when no optical fiber is being 
drawn from the preform.
