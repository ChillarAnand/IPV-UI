Abstract => Disclosed is a single mode optical waveguide fiber 
having a relatively large effective area and good bend 
resistance. The waveguide fiber is characterized by a 
segmented core having a central segment (30) and at 
least one annular segment (32, 34, 36) surrounding the 
central segment. At least one segment has a negative 
relative refractive index where the reference refractive 
index is taken as the index of the cladding. The total 
dispersion of the fiber is positive for wavelengths above 
about 1500 nm, dispersion slope is typically less than 
about 0.08 ps/nm2-km, and induced attenuation under pin 
array bend testing is typically less than 5 dB/km.
