Abstract => The invention concerns inflatable roof 
elements (1) comprising two air-filled layered flexible 
films (2, 3) and tightening ropes (4,5) associated with 
said films, resting on a support structure capable of 
supporting at least two juxtaposed roof elements (1) and 
designed to cover a specific volume for agricultural, 
horticultural, sporting purposes or the like. Said 
elements are essentially characterised in that the layered 
flexible films (2, 3) belong to a common closed sleeve, 
the tightening ropes (4, 5) are longitudinally positioned 
inside the sleeve and placed inside sheaths (9, 10) 
obtained by linear longitudinal welding of the two 
layered films (2, 3) of the sleeve at the rate of one weld 
seam (11) for the end sheaths (9) and two weld seams 
(12) for the intermediate sheaths (10).
