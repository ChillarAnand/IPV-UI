(10) made of an elastic material and a bottom plate (30) assembled 
with the body. The cover body (10) has a pair of contractible wing 
portions(12), each having an extension portion (14) horizontally 
extended inwardly from a lower portion thereof, respectively, a pair 
of auxiliary holes (16), each formed at top of the body, and a 
shoestring rest pin (18) mounted on a tip of each of the extension 
portions (14). The extension portions (14) have a jaw (20) at a tip 
end thereof for preventing the wing portions (12) from excessively 
contracting and a fixing hole (22) at a side wall thereof for inserting 
a shoestring passing out thereinto. The bottom plate (30) has a pair 
of string access holes (32) and a partition (34) projected upwardly 
between the string access holes (32) in such a way that an inner 
portion of the cover body (10) is divided into two hollow portions.
