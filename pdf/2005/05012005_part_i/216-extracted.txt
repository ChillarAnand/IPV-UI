Title => PROLONGED RELEASE MICROSPHERE ENCAPSULATING  
                                       LUTEINIZING HORM ONE-RELEASING HORMONE ANALOGUES  
                                       AND METHOD FOR PREPARING THE SAME 
 

International Classification => A 61 K 38/24,  
Abstract => There is disclosed a prolonged release microsphere which can constantly release medicinal drugs, 
such as luteinizing hormone- releasing hormone analogues and encapsulate them at high content 
rates.  It is prepared by dissolving a copolymer of lactide and gycolide in methylene chloride, 
dissolving a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue and a release- controlling material in a 
subsidiary solvent, combining the above two solutions with each other to produce an emulsion phase, 
dispersing  the emulsion phase in a solution of polyvinyl alcohol in distilled water to give a single 
emulsion system, removing the combined solvent of the emulsion phase to generate a polymeric 
microsphere; freeze-drying the polymeric microsphere. The microsphere prepared has a much finer 
inner structure, by virtue of which the microsphere  is secured in a constant release rate.  The single 
emulsion system which simplifies the preparation, allows for the maintenance of a drug content of 
10% or more.  The charged groups of the release-controlling materials associated with the polymers 
minimize the excess release of the oppositely charged drugs at an initial stage, playing an important 
role in keeping the release rate constant.
