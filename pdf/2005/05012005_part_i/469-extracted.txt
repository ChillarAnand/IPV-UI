VOLTAGE DOUBLER OUTPUT 
 

International Classification => H02M 3/338 
Name of inventor => 1. YASUMURA MASAYUKI 
 

Abstract => A switching power supply circuit 
includes an insulating converter transformer where the 
insulating converter transformer has a gap formed 
therein so that a coupling which is efficient for a loose 
coupling is obtained; switching circuit, a primary side 
parallel resonance circuit formed from a leakage 
inductance component from the primary winding of the 
insulating converter transformer and a capacitance of a 
parallel resonance capacitor and a secondary side 
series resonance circuit including a secondary side 
series resonance capacitor and a secondary winding of 
the insulating converter transformer; a dc output voltage 
production means for performing a voltage multiplying 
full-wave rectification operation to produce a secondary 
side dc output voltage substantially equal to twice the 
input voltage level; and a constant voltage control 
means for varying a switching frequency of the 
switching element in order to perform constant voltage 
control of the secondary side output voltage.
