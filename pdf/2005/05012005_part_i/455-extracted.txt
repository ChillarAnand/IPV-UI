Abstract => A container for a fuel system additive. 
The container comprises a sealable first part (1) for 
storing the fuel system additive and a second part (2) 
that is capable of opening a flap on a vehicle's fuel tank. 
The two parts are capable of relative movement which 
unseals the first part (1) so that the fuel system additive 
can leave the first part (1) and travel through the second 
part (2) into a vehicle's fuel tank. The container avoids 
or reduces spillage of the fuel system additive.
