Abstract => Compositions and methods for the therapy and diagnosis of cancer, such as prostate 
cancer, are disclosed.  Compositions may comprise one or more prostate tumor proteins, immunogenic 
portions thereof, or polynucleotides that encode such portions.  Alternatively, a therapeutic composition 
may comprise an antigen presenting cell that expresses a prostate tumor protein, or a T cell that is specific 
for cells expressing such a protein.  Such compositions may be used, for example, for the prevention and 
treatment of diseases such as prostate cancer.  Diagnostic methods based on detecting a prostate tumor 
protein, or mRNA encoding such a protein, in a sample are also provided.
