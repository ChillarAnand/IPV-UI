Title => METHOD FOR PURIFYING MELAMINE. 
 

International Classification => C 07 D 251/62 (71) 
Abstract => The invention relates to a method for purifying melamine in which impure melamine is heated to a 
temperature range above 325ÂºC but lower than the melting point of melamine which depends on the 
prevailing ammonia pressure.  In addition, the impure melamine is held in said temperature range under an 
ammonia pressure ranging from 1 to 150 bar for a duration from 1 minute up to 20 hours.  The melamine is 
provided in solid form.  Afterwards, the melamine is relieved from pressure and cooled in any order.
