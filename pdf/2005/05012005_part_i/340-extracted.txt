Abstract => An improved method for cleaning and 
sterilizing medical and dental instruments (16) employs 
the use of a banding device (10) to segregate and hold 
together medical or dental instruments (16) after use in 
a particular procedure. The banded instruments (16) are 
then cleaned and sterilized. This method essentially 
eliminates the time and effort formerly required when 
unsegregated instruments were mixed with other 
instruments for cleaning and sterilization and then 
stored according to the particular procedure for which 
they are intended and/or according to the intended 
particular user thereof.
