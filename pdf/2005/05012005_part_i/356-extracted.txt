Abstract => A polymer blend is described which contains at least one acrylic resin or vinyl resin having at least one 
ionic or ionizable group and at least one thermoplastic fluoropolymer. Preferably, the polymer blend is an 
intimate blend of the two polymers which are useful in a variety of applications including in the 
formation of a membrane which is useful in batteries and fuel cells and the like. Methods of making the 
polymer blends are also described.
