International Classification => C 07 C 67/313 (71) 
Abstract => The invention relates to a method for producing glyoxylic acid esters from glyoxilic acid ester 
hemiacetals which a) are directly transesterified with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst; or b) are firstly 
converted into the corresponding glyoxylic acid whole acetals and are then transesterified with an alcohol in 
the presence of a catalyst, whereupon after a) and b) the acetals are divided into the desired, free glyoxylic
