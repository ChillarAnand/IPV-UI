Abstract => The invention is directed to fine denier 
poly(trimethylene terephthalate) feed yarns and drawn 
yarns and their manufacture. The yarns are drawn 
such that the actual draw ratio is within 10 percent of 
the predicted draw ratio determined according to: 
[(elongation to break of the feed 
yarn)+115]/[(elongation to break of the drawn 
yarn)+115)].
