Abstract => An electric toothbrush is provided which includes an elongate body having and interior cavity, a power 
source mounted within the cavity, an elongate drive shaft driven rotatably by the power source, a camwheel mounted on 
the drive shaft, a yoke with projecting arms which confine travel of the camwheel, a crankshaft section driven by the drive 
shaft, an output shaft axially aligned to the drive shaft, and a collar with a guide track eccentrically coupling the 
crankshaft section to the output shaft thereby imparting both lateral and rotary reciprocating motion to the output shaft.  A 
brushhead mounted on the front end of the elongate body accepts the motion from the output shaft.  The mechanical drive 
system is fully enclosed within the housing of the elongate body.  Brushheads are replaceably mountable outside the 
cavity on the front end.
