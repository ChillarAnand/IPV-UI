Title => FERMENTATION PROCESS TO PRODUCE CLAVULANIC ACID AT  
                                       A LOW CONCENTRATION OF FREE AMINO ACIDS 
 

International Classification => C 12 P 17/18, 
Abstract => An improved method for the production of secondary metabolites by the fermentation of a Streptomyces 
strain has been disclosed. If the concentration of free amino acids is kept low, a surprisingly high yield is 
obtained.
