Title => NEW DERIVATIVES OF 6-(4-PHENYLBUTOXY)HEXYLAMINE AND  
                                       PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SALMETEROL 
 

International Classification => C 07 C 217/00 (71) 
Abstract => The present invention relates to new derivatives of 6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexylamine having the 
general formula (I) wherein R1 is CHO, or CHOR3OR4, wherein R3 and R4 are independently C1-C6 
alkyl, aralkyl or can form cyclic acetals with 5 or 6 members; R2 is H, benzyl or a group 
alkyloxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl, aralkyloxycarbonyl or acyle; the invention also relates to the 
process for producing  them.  The invention also relates to a new process for producing salmeterol or 
the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and which is characterized in that an organometallic 
compound is reacted with a compound having the general formula (I) wherein R1 is CHO and R2 is 
alkyloxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl, aralkyloxycarbonyl or an acyl group.
