Abstract => A method and a device for utilization of mobile radio 
telephones for surveillance and/or control purposes in 
which a radio unit (3) for reception of signals from mobile 
radio telephones is arranged to be activated in a first step 
by an incoming signal from a mobile radio telephone, as a 
second step analysing the first part of received signal with 
regard to the PIN/SIM number (or corresponding) and/or 
inputted call number during the handshaking procedure 
between the mobile radio telephone and an associated base 
station for comparison with preprogrammed corresponding 
information, and as a third step, when correspondence has 
been established, initiate preprogrammed procedures 
and/or actions, and if non-correspondence is established 
return to "resting" and non-activated condition pending a 
signal inputted from a mobile radio telephone. The 
receiving radio unit (3) is preferably performing a scanner 
function in "resting" condition with regard to within the 
geographical area utilized frequencies for mobile 
telephones, and performs a locking operation to the 
frequency for an incoming signal, maintaining this locking 
when approval for the third step is established, and 
returning

thereafter, as well as when non-acceptance is established 
during the second or third step, to "resting" function with 
scanning of the frequencies. The reception range for used 
radio unit (3) is preferably maintained restricted during 
the first and second step, and extended during the third 
step, whereby reception of called subscriber can be 
accomplished from the base station communicating with 
the mobile radio telephone.
