Abstract => The invention relates to a novel method for the production of 2-heterocyclyl methyl benzoic acid derivatives of 
general formula (I), wherein n, X and Z have the meaning cited in the description, providing good yields and high 
purity. The invention is characterized in that phthalide of general formula (II), wherein n and X have the meaning 
cited in the description, is reacted with nitrogen heterocycles of general formula (III): H-Z, wherein Z has the meaning 
cited in the description, or with nitrogen heterocycle metal salts of general formula (II) in the presence of an aprotic 
polar diluent and optionally in the presence of a basic auxiliary reaction agent.
