Abstract => A gun including a barrel assembly 
feed (19) for advancing a plurality of barrel assemblies 
(14) of the type having a plurality of projectiles stacked 
axially within each barrel assembly (30) together with 
discrete selectively ignitable propellant charges for 
propelling the projectiles from each barrel assembly 
(30), the plurality of barrel assemblies (14) being linked 
together in spaced apart parallel relationship (15) and 
locating one or more barrel assemblies (30) in a firing 
station wherein the firing station operatively supports the 
one or more barrel assemblies (30), the gun further 
including a charge initiator associated with the firing 
station for selectively initiating said discrete selectively 
ignitable propellant charges of one or more barrel 
assemblies (30) operatively supported by the firing 
station. The barrel assembly (30), has an inner barrel 
(32) made of a hard, non-deformable material and an 
outer casing (33) of a ductile material. The outer casing 
may be deformed by the slots (20) and sprocket teeth 
(21) of a sprocket drive.
