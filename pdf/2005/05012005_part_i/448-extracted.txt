Abstract => A process for the polymerization of olefins is provided.  The process involves contacting 
at least one olefin with at least one metallocene catalysts in the presence of a specified compound that 
results in the production of polymeric products having a narrower molecular weight distribution.  Also 
provided is a process for narrowing the molecular weight distribution of a polyolefin comprising 
contacting an olefin, at least one metallocene catalyst and a compound specified herein.  Further 
provided are polyolefins, and films and articles produced therefrom.
