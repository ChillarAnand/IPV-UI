Title => HOLLOW CATHODE ARRAY FOR PLASMA GENERATION 
 

International Classification => H 01 J 37/32 (71) 
Abstract => This invention relates to a cathode assembly for 
use in the creation of a discharge plasma. The 
cathode comprises a plurality of electrically 
conductive hollow plasma generating cells in an 
array, the cells being electrically connected to each 
other. The plasma generated can be used to modify 
surface properties of substrates, such as films, 
fibers, particles and other articles.
