Abstract => Method and apparatus 
for cutting a fluorinated polymer 
membrane and simultaneously joining 
it to a polymer frame. The method 
comprising the steps of: (i) contacting 
a fluorinated polymer membrane with 
a polymer frame at the point where a 
cut and join is desired, and (ii) 
directing at least one laser beam onto 
the point of contact between the 
membrane and the frame so as to cut 
the membrane and effect a join to the 
frame.
