Title => LATENT HEAT BODY WITH PORE STRUCTURE AND METHOD FOR  
                                       THE PRODUCTION THEREOF 
 

International Classification => F 28 D 20/02, 
Abstract => The present invention relates to a latent heat body (1, 17, 
20, 30, 39, 49, 50) with a paraffin-base latent heat storage 
material (7, 7',7'', 54, 55) lodged in a support material (5) 
having locating chambers. The invention aims at 
improving said latent heat body in such a way that it 
exhibits high heat storage capabilities while being easy to 
produce, that it exhibits sufficient structural resistance 
even when it is in a heated state and that the support 
material is automatically filled with latent heat storage 
material to the greatest possible extent. To this end, 
capillary locating chambers (6) for the latent heat storage 
material (7, 7',7'', 54, 55) are configured inside the 
support material (5) and the support material (5) contains 
a mineral matter with open capillary pore structure (8). 
The invention also relates to a method for the production 
of a latent heat body (1, 17, 20, 30, 39, 49, 50) with a 
paraffin-base latent heat storage material (7, 7',7'', 54, 55) 
lodged in a support material (5) having locating 
chambers. In order to enable easy and cost-effective
