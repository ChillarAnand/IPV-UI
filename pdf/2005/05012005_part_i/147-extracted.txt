Abstract => A novel for producing homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene which involves 
contacting ethylene and/or ethylene and at least one or more other olefin(s) under polymerization 
conditions with a Ziegler-Natta type catalyst, at least one halogenated hydrocarbon, at least one 
compound of the formula XnER3-n as a co-catalyst and at least one compound containing at least one 
carbon-oxygen-carbon linkage (C-O-C) of the formula R1-O(-R2-O)n-R3 as an external electron donor.  
Also provided are films and articles produced therefrom.
