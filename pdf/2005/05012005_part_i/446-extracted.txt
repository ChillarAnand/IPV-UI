Abstract => A novel process for the purification of poloxamers which contain aldehyde impurities 
and particularly for the purification of the poloxamers named poloxamer 188 and poloxamer 407, which 
process includes dissolving the poloxamer(s) in a solvent which solvent may optionally contain an acid 
or a mixture or acids: if the solvent in which the poloxamer(s) has been dissolved is free from acid, acid 
is added; whereafter the aldehydes are removed.
