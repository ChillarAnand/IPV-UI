Abstract => The invention is directed to a single mode optical 
waveguide fiber profile (18, 20, 22, 24) that provides 
relatively large effective area while limiting macrobend 
loss. The large effective area results from configuring the 
core of the waveguide fiber to shift propagated light power 
away from the waveguide center. Macrobend loss, as 
measured by pin array or 20 mm mandrel testing, is 
maintained low by means of a power-limiting index 
depression (24) surrounding the central core region of the 
waveguide. In addition, low attenuation is achieved and cut 
off wavelength is controlled to provide a 
telecommunications operating window in the wavelength 
range of about 1250 nm to 1700 nm.
