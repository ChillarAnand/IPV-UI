Title => ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL CLOSURE. 
 

International Classification => H 01 M (71) 
Abstract => An electrochemical cell (8) having a high capacity is described. The 
cell (8) capacity can be increased by a method of selecting cell 
components to achieve particular volume ratios within the cell. 
Specific volume ratios that lead to improved capacity include the 
ratio of the internal cell volume to the external volume, the ratio of 
the closure volume to the external volume, the ratio of the closure 
volume to the internal cell volume, the ratio of the seal volume to the 
internal cell volume, and the ratio of the seal volume to the external 
volume.
