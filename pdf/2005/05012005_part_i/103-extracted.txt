Abstract => The present invention concerns a process for clavulanic acid production by aerobic 
fermentation using selected and/or culture collection strains of Streptomyces clavuligerus, or mutants 
thereof.  Accordingly, the culture is carried out with continuous or semicontinuous feeding of one or more 
organic nitrogen complex sources, preferably soybean meal, so as to control the protein concentration in 
the filtered broth within certain limits during the time course of the fermentation.  The described 
conditions led to significant improvements in the clavulanic acid fermentation.
