Abstract => A building element (10) comprises a topless 
and bottomless box constituted of a pair of 
interlocking L-shaped members (12 and 14). 
The L-shaped members interlock at diagonally 
opposite corners (16) and may be filled and 
secured by a number of means including clay, 
sand, stone, cement or concrete. The building 
elements are stackable and include a peripheral 
channel (18) at the top of the walls, and a 
peripheral lip (20) at the bottom for receiving 
the lip (18) of an adjacent stacked building 
element. The side walls of the element 
comprise grids or lattice (22). The intersection 
points of the grid are provided with studs (28) 
having pointed tips (30) which assist in levering 
the plaster applied.
