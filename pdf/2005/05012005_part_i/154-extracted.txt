Abstract => The invention concerns 3-piece rail 
bogies of the type which have a transverse bolster (10) 
and a pair of side frames (12) on which the bolster is 
suspended at its ends on upright bolster springs (22) 
acting between the bolster and the side frames. The 
invention proposes that the bolster ends be formed with 
downwardly opening concavities (14, 16, 18, 20) to 
receive the upper ends of the bolster springs. With this 
feature it is possible to accommodate longer bolster 
springs than normal, giving an improved ride quality in 
both the vertical and lateral sense. Alternatively, 
resilient shear pads can be located beneath shorter 
bolster springs to take account of allowable variations in 
rail vehicle coupler heights.
