Abstract => The present invention provides for preparation of crystalline 1-[3-(dimethylamino) propyl]-1-(4-
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofuran carbonitrile, a compounds of formulation 1, comprising 
Comprising, 
a) subjecting 5-cyanopthalide to a Grignard reaction with 4-fluorophenyl magnesium halide at a low 
temperature, 
b) subjecting the resultant  reaction mixture to a Grignard reaction with 3- dimethylsminopropyl 
magnesium halide at a low temperature, 
c) treating the resultant compounds of formulation 2, 4-[4-(dimethylamino)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-
hydroxybutyl]-3-(hydroxymethyl) benzonitrile with the acid, 
d) isolating the crystalline compounds of formulation 1, 
Wherein, 
(i) the low temperature in step ‘a’ and ‘b’ are such, and 
(ii) the acid used in step ‘c’ is in such amount concentration, 
that the compounds of formulation 1 obtained in step ‘d’ crystalline.
