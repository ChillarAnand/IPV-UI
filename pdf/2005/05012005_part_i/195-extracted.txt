Abstract => The present invention relates to a mobile station 
(MS), a method and a node (MS, HLR, MSC, 
VLR) in a mobile communications system 
(PLMN). In a system of this nature, it is 
possible that several transactions (TCH, 
USSD1, USSD2) are in progress at one and the 
same time, i.e. are ongoing in parallel with a 
mobile station (MS). One problem is that a user 
of the mobile station (MS) will become 
mentally stressed by receiving information from 
several sources over different transactions at 
one and the same time. Another problem is that 
a USSD transaction degrades the quality of a 
typical speech connection (TCH) which is 
ongoing in parallel. One solution is to register 
beforehand an admission which states whether a 
transaction can be set up or not. When a request 
for a new transaction (TCH, USSD1, USSD2) is 
received, the user admission is checked and the 
requested transaction inhibited in accordance 
with said admission.
