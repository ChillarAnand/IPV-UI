Abstract => This invention relates to methods of extracting in 
solution a metal catalyst from a reaction mixture 
produced by oxidizing cyclohexane to adipic acid in the 
presence of acetic acid and the metal catalyst. According 
to this invention, substantially the totality of the 
cyclohexane is removed, as well as a major part of the 
adipic acid. A major part of the acetic acid is also 
removed without precipitating catalyst, thus forming a 
concentrate in solution. In a preferred embodiment of the 
instant invention, the concentrate enters a counter-
current stream of counter flowing water and 
cyclohexanone, resulting in an aqueous solution of metal 
catalyst, which is the extract, and a phase of concentrate 
solution dissolved in cyclohexanone, which is the 
raffinate. The two solutions are further treated and/or 
recycled.
