Title => X-RAY FLUORESCENT EMISSION ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE  
                                       MATERIAL CONCENTRATION 
 

International Classification => G 01 N 23/223 (71) 
Abstract => A method and apparatus is disclosed to 
determine a concentration of dopant in soot 
that constitutes at least a portion of a soot 
preform (12) used to form an optical wave 
guide. The photon source (30) irradiates the 
soot preform on a mandrel (14). X-ray 
fluorescent emissions, from the irradiated 
soot are detected, and the concentration of 
dopant is determined based on the detected 
X-ray fluorescent emissions. Additionally, 
the concentration of dopant in layers of soot 
on the preform can be controlled by utilizing 
the detected X-ray fluorescent emissions to 
determine a deviation between a 
concentration of dopant in the soot and a 
predetermined concentration, and adjusting 
deposition conditions based on the deviation.
