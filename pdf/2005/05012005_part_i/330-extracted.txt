Abstract => A process for producing a thermoformed package comprises the steps of placing a first sheet of film 
over a forming die having at least one cavity, heating the film to mould the film into the at least one cavity thereby 
forming at least one recess in the film, placing a composition in the at least one formed recess, and sealing a 
second sheet of film across the at least one formed recess to produce at least one closed package. Each cavity is 
cooled to between 2 and 10 degrees C.
