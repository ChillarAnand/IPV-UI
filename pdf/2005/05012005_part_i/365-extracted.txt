Abstract => The present invention relates to an arrangement in a 
cavity filter for tuning the frequency relationship of 
the filter or its coupling coefficient factor. The 
arrangement includes a self-locking screw that can be 
fitted in the filter cavity, for instance in the centre 
conductor, in the filter lid, or in some suitable place in 
the filter chassis. Tuning is effected by adjusting the 
position of the screw in relation to the centre 
conductor or lid of the cavity filter. The screw can be 
made of metallic segments embedded in plastic, or 
made completely of metal, and provided with a 
radially through-penetrating slot. At least one part of 
the screw has a cross-sectional area whose extension 
perpendicular to the through-penetrating slot is 
slightly greater than in a direction along said slot.
