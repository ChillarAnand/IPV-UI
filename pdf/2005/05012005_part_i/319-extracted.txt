Abstract => This invention provides a method to prepare liposome-encapsulated bioactive agents such as nucleic 
acids, comprising complexation of the bioactive agents in reverse micelles prior to forming 
liposomes, as well as methods of using the liposomes so formed and formulations to deliver nucleic 
acids to cells.
