Abstract => A system for measuring polarization 
mode dispersion (PMD) in a fiber using a polarizer 
controlling the polarization state of light input to the fiber 
and a polarization analyzer measuring the polarization 
state of light output from the fiber. Jones matrix analysis 
is applied to data derived from three input polarization 
states and two wavelenghts of probing radiation. 
Performance is improved by using incoherent light 
sources such as light emitting diodes in conjunction with 
two bandpass filters. However, a laser source and 
optical detector are used to align the fiber. The system 
is particularly useful in measuring PMD values in short 
lengths of fiber and mapping those values with a long 
fiber from which the test fiber was cut. Preferably, the 
PMD is measured for various values of twist 
experimentally induced in the test fiber, and the short-
length PMD value is that associated with zero-internal 
twist in the fiber as calculated according to a model. The 
fiber may also be loaded during measurement.
