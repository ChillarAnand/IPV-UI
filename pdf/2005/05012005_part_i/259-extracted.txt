Title => METHOD FOR HIGH YIELD EXTRACTION OF 
PACLITAXEL FROM PACLITAXEL-CONTAINING 
MATERIAL. 
 

International Classification => C 07 D 305/14 (71) 
Abstract => A method of isolating paclitaxel from paclitaxel-containing material that includes the steps 
of obtaining an acetone mixture of the paclitaxel-containing material, then mixing the acetone mixture with 
an aqueous solvent to form an aqueous supernatant and a precipitate, wherein the precipitate contains at least 
3-times higher paclitaxel content than the paclitaxel extract.  The acetone/water precipitation steps provides 
a high yield of highly pure paclitaxel that is suitable for industrial scale isolation using conventional normal-
phase silica chromatography steps, and the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions containing 
paclitaxel.
