Abstract => An optical waveguide, radiation emitting 
device employing the same, and process for fabricating the 
radiation emitting device are provided. The optical 
waveguide has a core (12) fabricated of a first material with 
a first index of refraction and cladding (14) surrounding the 
core (12) fabricated of a second material with a second 
index of refraction. The core is an active material which 
emits radiation at a desired wavelength when pumped with 
radiation of a predetermined wavelength, and the first 
material and second material are dissimilar materials (R1, 
R2), having been separately fabricated and subsequently 
physically assembled as the waveguide. The light emitting 
device employing the optical waveguide is configured 
either as an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) source 
or laser source employing appropriate reflective materials 
at the ends of the optical waveguide.
