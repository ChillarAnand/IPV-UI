Abstract => Site-specific isotopically-labeled valine, leucine, and isoleucine and biosynthetic precursors for these 
amino acids are provided.  The amino acids are labeled with 13C or 14C at the methyl group carbon 
atoms(s) most remote from the carboxyl group. Also disclosed are the biochemical precursors of these 
labeled amino acids, 2-keto-4-(nC) butyric acid and 2-keto-3-(nC-methyl)-4-(nC)-butyric acid in which n, 
at each occurrence, is 13 or 14. Also disclosed are proteins, protein fragments and polypeptides 
containing these site-specifically isotopically labeled amino acids, and methods for preparing the 
biochemical precursors, the amino acids, and the proteins, protein fragments, and polypeptides.
