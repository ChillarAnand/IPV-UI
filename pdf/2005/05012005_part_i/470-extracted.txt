Abstract => A switching power supply circuit, which 
is small, lightweight, and highly efficient in power 
conversion, includes an insulating converter 
transformer, which is formed by a core with no gap and 
a primary and secondary winding wound on the core 
such that the mutual inductance between the windings 
exhibits an additive mode. A half-wave rectifier circuit is 
provided on the secondary side of the circuit and 
performs a rectification operation in the additive mode to 
obtain a secondary side DC output voltage. In a 
constant voltage control circuit system for stabilizing the 
secondary side output voltage, the switching frequency 
of a switching element is varied in response to the 
secondary side output voltage level to control the 
resonance impedance of a primary side parallel 
resonance circuit and the continuity angle of the 
switching element compositely.
