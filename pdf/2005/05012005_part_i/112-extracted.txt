Abstract => The preparation and use of an isolated nucleic acid fragment which confers a Pi-ta 
resistance gene-mediated defense response in plants against disease caused by fungal pathogens is 
described.  Genes incorporating such nucleic acid fragments either alone or in combination with an AVR-
Pita isolated nucleic acid fragment or functionally equivalent subfragments thereof and suitable 
regulatory sequences can be used to create transgenic plants which can produce a Pi-ta resistance gene-
mediated defense response against a variety of fungal pathogens, in particular, the rice blast fungus.
