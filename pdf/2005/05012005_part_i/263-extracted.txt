Title => HIGH-PERFORMANCE ABSORBENT STRUCTURE. 
 

International Classification => B 32 B 27/04 (71) 
Abstract => Disclosed is an absorbent structure having wet integrity 
higher than about 4.0 kN/gsm, softness higher than 8.0/J, 
pliability higher than about 70/N, and providing a 
substantially dry liquid-accepting surface after receiving a 
quantity of liquid. The structure includes an upper ply (82) 
having an upper fluid receiving surface and a lower surface 
and including (i) a top stratum (6) including synthetic 
matrix fibers bonded with a binder, the matrix fibers having 
a length from about 2 to about 15 mm; (ii) a middle stratum 
(8) in fluid communication with the top stratum (6), the 
middle stratum (8) including natural fibers, superabsorbent 
particles and a binder; and (iii) a bottom stratum (10) in 
fluid communication with the middle stratum (8), the 
bottom stratum (10) including natural fibers and a binder. 
The structure also includes a lower ply (4) in fluid 
communication with the upper ply (2), the lower ply (4) 
having an upper surface and a lower surface and including 
at least one stratum (13) including natural fibers, 
superabsorbent polymer particles, and a binder, wherein the 
lower surface of the upper ply (2) has a surface area less 
than about 80 % of the upper surface area of the lower ply 
(4).
