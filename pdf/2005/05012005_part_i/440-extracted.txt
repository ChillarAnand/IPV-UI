Abstract => Presbyopia and other eye disorders are treated by 
implanting within a plurality of elongated pockets formed in the 
tissue of the sclera of the eye transverse to a meridian of the eye, a 
prosthesis having an elongated base member having an inward 
surface adapted to be placed against the inward wall of the pocket 
and having a ridge on the inward surface of the base extending 
along at least a major portion of the major dimension of the base. 
The combined effect of the implanted prostheses is to exert a 
radially outward traction of the sclera in the region overlying the 
ciliary body which expands the sclera in the affected region 
together with the underlying ciliary body. The expansion of the 
ciliary body restores the effective working distance of the ciliary 
muscle in the presbyopic eye and thereby increases the amplitude 
of accommodation. Introduced is an improved scleral prosthesis 
for the treatment of presbyopia and other eye disorders. An 
exemplary prosthesis is adapted for contact with the sclera of an 
eyeball,  
  
 
 
 
 
and comprises a body having a first end and a second 
end wherein the body has (i) a planform adapted to 
expand the contacted sclera to increase the effective 
working distance of the ciliary muscle of the eyeball, 
and (ii) means for stabilizing the prosthesis within the 
surgically formed pocket within the sclera of the 
eyeball.
