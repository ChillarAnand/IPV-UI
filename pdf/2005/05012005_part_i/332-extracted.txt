Abstract => The invention relates to flame-resistant polycarbonate moulding materials modified with graft polymers, containing 
phosphorus compounds and specially prepared fluorinated polyolefins. Said moulding materials are characterized 
by excellent flame resistance and very good mechanical properties such as impact strength and ultimate elongation 
as well as very high stress-crack resistance.
