Abstract => A fault-tolerant client-server system has 
a primary server, a backup server; and a client. The 
client sends a request to the primary server, which 
receives and processes the request, including sending 
the response to the client, independent of any backup 
processing. The response includes the primary server 
state information. The primary server also performs 
backup processing that includes periodically sending the 
primary server state information to the backup server. 
The client receives the response from the primary 
server, and sends the primary server state information to 
the backup server. The primary server state information 
includes all request-reply pairs that the primary server 
has handled since a most recent transmission of primary 
server state information from the primary server to the 
backup server. The primary server's means for 
performing backup processing may be activated 
periodically based on a predetermined time interval. 
Alternatively, it may be activated when the primary 
server's memory for storing the primary server state 
information is filled to a predetermined amount. Figure: 2.
