International Classification => B 01 D 50/00 (71) 
Abstract => An emissions reduction system (10) comprising 
an emission gas inlet (22) for receiving 
emissions-containing gas, and an emissions 
reducing device (10) for reducing emissions 
contained in the emissions-containing gas. The 
emissions reducing device is coupled at a first 
end thereof to the emission gas inlet (22) and an 
emission gas outlet (30) is coupled at a second 
end of the emissions reducing device for 
releasing emissions-reduced gas. The emissions 
reducing device comprises: a torturous fluid 
channel (100), lava material (50) displaced within 
the torturous fluid channel (100) wherein the lava 
material (50) is located within a set of sell 
contained containers (24 a-c) within the 
emissions reducing device (10).
