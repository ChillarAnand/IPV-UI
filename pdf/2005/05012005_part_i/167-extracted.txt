Abstract => A piece of soiled fabric (39) is cleaned 
by contacting it with a jet of an ionized soil-dislodging 
gas to dislodge the soil therefrom. The ionized gas and 
the use of an oppositely charged electrostatic filter (34) 
aid in preventing redeposition of the soil onto the fabric 
(39). The fabric (39) may be agitated while it is 
contacted with the gas jet. A portion of the piece of 
fabric (39) may be treated with an electrostatic spotting 
compound that enhances the effect of the ionized gas 
and may also enhance the removal of the soil. An 
apparatus (30) for accomplishing the cleaning includes a 
container (36) having an interior (38) in which the fabric 
(39) is received, a gas jet nozzle (46) directed into the 
interior (38) of the container (36), a source (50, 52) of a 
pressurized gas communicating with an inlet of the gas 
jet nozzle (46), a gas jet manifold (44) extending from 
the source (50, 52) to the gas jet nozzle (46), and a gas 
ionizer (80) disposed to ionize the pressurized gas 
passing through the gas jet nozzle (46).
