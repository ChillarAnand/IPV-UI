Abstract => A fish cage having one or more air-tight 
buoyancy rings (1) being entirely or partially hollow, with 
water valves (20) for inlet and outlet of water, and air valves (3) 
for injection and outlet of air, and preferably with closing shot 
plates (2) in the buoyancy ring (1). The novel feature according 
to the invention is that at least one or more of the air valves (3), 
and preferably also the air valves (20) are arranged inside of the 
buoyancy ring (1) so that the air valves (3) and water valves 
(20) are protected from external mechanical influence.
