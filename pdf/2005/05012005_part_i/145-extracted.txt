Abstract => A process for the polymerization of olefins is provided.  The process involves contacting 
at least one olefin with a Ziegler-Natta catalyst in the presence of dinitrogen monoxide in the production 
of polymeric products having a narrower molecular weight distribution.  A process for narrowing 
molecular weight distribution of polyolefins utilizing dinitrogen monoxide is also provided.
