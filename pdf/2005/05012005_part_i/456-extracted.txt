Abstract => A method is disclosed for recovering germanium from a gaseous mixture which includes a 
germanium-containing compound in vapor or particulate form, acid in vapor form, and water vapor. The gaseous 
mixture is contacted with a liquid containing water under conditions effective to dissolve the germanium-containing 
compound in the liquid. The acidity of the resulting liquid mixture is increased under conditions effective to vaporize 
the germanium-containing compound. The vaporized germanium-containing compound is contacted with one or 
more aqueous solutions under conditions effective to dissolve and precipitate the germanium-containing compound 
in at least one of the one or more aqueous solutions, and the resulting precipitate is separated from the at least one 
of the one or more aqueous solutions. The methods described herein are particularly well suited for recovering 
germanium from the waste gases produced during optical waveguide manufacturing processes. Germanium 
recovered by this method can thereafter be used in the production of semiconductors, optical waveguide fibers and 
optical components.
