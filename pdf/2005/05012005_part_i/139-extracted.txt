Title => ELECTROCHROMIC DEVICE WITH A YELLOW FILTER 
 

International Classification => C 09 K 9/02  
Abstract => The invention relates to a light-protected electrochromic device containing a pair of glass or plastic 
sheets or plastic films.  One side of at least one of said sheets or films, preferably both sheets or 
films, is provided with an electroconductive coating. At least one of said sheets or films and its 
electroconductive coating are transparent and the other can be metallised.  The electroconductive 
coating of at least one of the two sheets or films can be divided up into separate, individually 
contacted surface segments. The sheets or films are joined by a sealing ring on the sides of their 
electroconductive coatings and the volume created by the sheets or films and the sealing ring is filled 
with an electrochromic medium.  The invention is characterized in that the electrochromic device 
contains a yellow filter for which the wavelength at which absorbance in the long-wave flank reaches 
half of the very long-wave maximum absorbance value is between 370 and 500nm, preferably 
between 380 and 470 nm.  The invention is characterized by a considerably improved resistance to 
light in its activated state.
