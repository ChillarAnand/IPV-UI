Title => LONG HAUL SINGLE MODE WAVEGUIDE 
 

International Classification => G 02 B 6/02 (71) 
Abstract => Disclosed is a single mode optical waveguide 
fiber having a segmented core. The relative 
indexes, the refractive index profiles and the 
radii of the segments are chosen to provide 
waveguide fiber properties advantageously used 
in severe environments, such as, undersea 
cables. The segmented core waveguide fiber 
has a negative total dispersion over the 
operating window of about 1530 nm to 1570 
nm, which serves to eliminate soliton 
formation. The key properties of dispersion 
zero, cut off wavelength, attenuation, and bend 
resistance fall within desired ranges. The 
waveguide also features a low polarization 
mode dispersion.
