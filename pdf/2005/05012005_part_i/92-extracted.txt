Title => EXTRACTION OF HEMICELLULOSIC MATERIALS 
 

International Classification => C 08 B 37/14,  
Abstract => Hemicelluloses may be extracted by alkaline peroxide treatment without removal of ferulate 
residues.  Hemicelluloses prepared in this way retain their ability to gel.  Such gelling hemicelluloses 
may be extracted with a number of different oxidizing species including hydrogen peroxide anion, 
hydrogen peroxide radical, hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical and oxide radical. A process has thus 
been developed for producing a hemicellulose gel that may be carried out at cold temperatures, thus 
facilitating enzymic co-processing, and that is high yielding and produces a gel that is light in color.
