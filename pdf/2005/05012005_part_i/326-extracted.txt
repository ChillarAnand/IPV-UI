Abstract => A method and apparatus for maintenance 
charging a battery is disclosed. A battery is fully charged 
using conventional CC-CV techniques and subsequently 
is maintenance charged by applying a first maintenance 
voltage to the battery for a first predetermined time 
period. If desired, a second maintenance voltage may 
be applied to the battery for a second predetermined 
time period. An apparatus for maintenance charging a 
battery utilizes a timer and a charge controller to apply a 
maintenance voltage to a battery for a predetermined 
time period.
