Abstract => The invention relates to substrates based on vinylcyclohexane homopolymers, copolymers and 
blockpolymers, wherein comonomers are selected from the group consisting of olefins, acrylic acid derivatives, 
maleic acid derivatives, vinyl ether and vinyl ester or mixtures thereof and from at least two comonomers. The 
invention is characterized in that the moment of inertia of the substrate ranges from 280 to 50 g<.>cm<2> and 
specific density from 1 to 0.8 g/cm<3>.
