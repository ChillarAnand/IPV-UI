Abstract => A wireless communication system includes a 
multi-functional portable device and more than one host systems 
so as to accomplish various functions. The portable device 
performs at least one specific function with a host system and 
the host system has a transceiver and a host apparatus. 
Specifically, in order to achieve the purposes, the portable 
device includes a storage unit for storing at least a portion of 
information required in performing the specific function and a 
transceiver unit for transmitting the information to the host 
system in a form of an encrypted signal. The transceiver includes 
a control unit for decrypting the encrypted signal to reconstruct 
the information and a data interfacing unit for providing the 
reconstructed information to the host apparatus.
