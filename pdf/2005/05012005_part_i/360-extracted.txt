Abstract => The invention concerns a method for stereospecific preparation of 4-hydroxyalk-1-ene compounds of 
configuration (R) or (S) of general formula (I) wherein: X represents an oxygen atom, and in such case R 
is selected among an alkyl, aryl, trityl, SiR, [Si(Alkyl)3; Si(Alkyl)2Ph], cyclic ether, tetrahydrofuryl 
group, or a group of formula -CO-R'', wherein R'' represents an alkyl group or an aryl group; R' 
represents the lone pair of oxygen; and n is a whole number not less than 1; or X represents a nitrogen 
atom, and in such case, R is selected among a hydrogen atom, an alkyl, aryl group; R' is selected among 
the groups of formulae -CO2R'', -SO2R'', -COR'', wherein R'' represents a alkyl group, an aryl group, or a 
-CF2 group, and n is a whole number not less than 1; by enantioselective allylic rearrangement reaction of 
aldehydes of formula (II) wherein X, R, R' and n are as defined in formula (I).
