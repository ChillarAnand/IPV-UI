Abstract => An Information and Application Distribution System 
(IADS) for distributing (500), initiating and allowing to play multi-
player games via the Internet. The IADS employs known Internet 
protocols such as Internet Relay Chat (IRC), HTTP and email 
protocols, (e.g., X.25) to distribute and initiate computer games such 
that the application's executable and information concerning virtual 
locations for application interactions are automatically installed on 
local computer. Application distribution occurs through the 
transmission (500) and receipt of an "application object" which 
contains both the application executable code and the application 
invoker for invoking the application and linking multiple users in 
connection with the specific application. The application object 
includes functionality which allows the user's local computer to 
automatically set-up a socket connection with a central controller 
which controls interaction (530) and introduction between and 
among users.
