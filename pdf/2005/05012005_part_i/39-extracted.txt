Title => ROTATION DETECTING APPARATUS 
 

International Classification => (71) 
Abstract => Sensors  fro motor and a 
reference position sensor are integrated in a 
sensor magnet for detection. An annular sensor 
magnet 11U,11V, and 11W for motor and with a 
magnetized zone M2 corresponding to a reference 
positions sensors 12. the individual magnetized 
portions of the magnetized zone M2 are shifted as 
a whole in a leftward direction by a distance D 
from the magnetized zone M1. however, the 
direction of shifting has been partly reversed. 
Specifically, the magnetized portion 23 of the 
magnetized zone M2 is shifted in the right 
direction so that the magnetized portion 24 and 
25 are narrowed accordingly. In this magnetized 
structure, the level of an output of the reference 
position sensor 12 is determined by generating 
triggers E1 to E6 on the rising edges of the sensor 
11 W for motor. Since the level is determined to 
be Low only at one position, the output of the 
reference position sensor is fetched based on the 
determination.
