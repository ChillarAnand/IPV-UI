Title => APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING WAVELENGTH-CONVERSION  
                                       USING PHOSPHORS WITH LIGHT EMITTING DIODES 
 

International Classification => H 01 J 1/62, 40/16 (71) 
Abstract => An apparatus (500), comprises an active region 
(530), a phosphor layer (550) and a reflective layer 
(520). The active region is configured to emit light 
having a first band of wavelengths from a first group 
of wavelengths. The phosphor layer is disposed 
between and in contact with the active region and an 
exterior medium. The phosphor layer is configured to 
convert the first band of wavelengths of light emitted 
from the active region to a second band of 
wavelengths. A center wavelength of the second 
band of wavelengths is greater than a center 
wavelength of the first band of wavelengths. The 
reflective layer is optically coupled to the active 
region. The active region is disposed between the 
reflective layer and the phosphor layer. The reflective 
layer is configured to reflect at least the first band of 
wavelengths and the second band of wavelengths.
