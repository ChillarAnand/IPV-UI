Title => POWER SUPPLY APPARATUS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE 
 

International Classification => (71) 
Abstract => To stabilize a voltage generated on a 
power supply line by an electric motor, prevent a 
battery from being overcharged, prevent an over voltage 
from being generated , and protect system components 
from an over voltage, even when a battery is removed 
or no electric power is supplied from the battery to a 
control means. [solving means ] A power supply 
apparatus in an electric vehicle has a drive circuit  5. a 
power supply state detecting circuit (activating unit) 12 
activates the control circuit 4 depending on a voltage 
value on a power  supply line of the motor 1. a voltage 
stabilizing means including a relay 10 and a 
regenerative resistor 11 stabilizes the voltage on the 
power supply line when the opening and closing of the 
relay 10 is controlled by the control circuit 4. the 
voltage stabilizing means may constitute the drive 
circuit 5.
