Title => COMPENSATING ELEMENT FOR A SENSOR 
 

International Classification => G 01 L 1/22, 
Abstract => The invention relates to a compensating 
element (4) for a sensor circuit which is 
equipped with strain gauges (2) in a bridge 
circuit (1). Said compensating element (4) 
consists of a metallic support plate (20) on 
which a structured resistance foil (24) is 
bonded in an insulating manner. Both the 
low-resistance trimming resistors (6, 16) 
and the high-resistance trimming resistors 
(13, 18) for compensating the temperature 
coefficient at zero (TKO) and the 
temperature coefficient at a characteristic 
value (TKK) are formed from the 
resistance foil (23) in a flat or grid form. 
The compensating element (4) can easily 
be connected to the sensor through the 
level support plate (20) with a suitable 
plastic and with good heat transfer. In the
