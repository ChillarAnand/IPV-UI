Title => DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE GENE FROM PLANTS. 
 

International Classification => C 12 N 15/54 (71) 
Abstract => The present invention relates to the isolation, purification, 
characterization and use of the plant diacylglycerol 
acyltransferase (DGAT) gene and genetic products. For 
example, the invention provides DGAT cDNA [SEQ ID NO:1] 
(pDGATcDNA; ATCC No PTA-989) and a plant diacylglycerol 
acyltransferase gene [SEQ ID NO:3] (pDGATgene; ATCC No 
PTA-988) from the Brassicaceae (specifically Arabidopsis 
thaliana). The invention includes isolated and purified DGAT 
DNA, preferably of the stated sequences and homologues, and 
relates to methods of regulating seed oil content, the ratio of 
diacylglycerol/triacylglycerol proportions in the seed oil, fatty 
acid synthesis, seed oil acyl composition, seed size/weight and 
carbon flux into other seed components, using the gene, and to 
tissues and plants transformed with the gene. The invention also 
relates to transgenic plants, plant tissues and plant seeds having 
a genome containing an introduced DNA sequence of the 
invention, and a method of producing such plants and plant 
seeds. The invention also relates to [SEQ ID NO:1] containing 
an 81 bp insertion [SEQ ID NO:23], and uses thereof to modify 
oil content, acyl composition of triacylglycerols, seed size or 
carbon flux into other seed components.
