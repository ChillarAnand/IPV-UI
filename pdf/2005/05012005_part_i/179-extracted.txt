Title => A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING WAVELENGTH- 
                                       CONVERSION USING PHOSPHORS WITH LIGHT EMITTING DIODES 
 

International Classification => H 01 L 33/00,   
Abstract => An apparatus (100) comprises an active region (120), a 
phosphor layer (140) and a substrate (130). The active 
region is configured to emit light having a first band of 
wavelengths selected from a first group of wavelengths. 
The phosphor layer has a first refractive index. The 
phosphor layer includes a plurality of wavelength-
converting phosphors. The phosphor layer is configured 
to convert the first band of wavelengths of light emitted 
from the active region to a second band of wavelengths. 
A center wavelength of the second band of wavelengths 
is greater than a center wavelength of the first band of 
wavelengths. The substrate is disposed between and in 
contact with the active region and the phosphor layer. 
The substrate has a second refractive index. The first 
refractive index substantially equals the second 
refractive index.
