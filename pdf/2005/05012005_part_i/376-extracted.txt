Abstract => A burner assembly (20) for a furnace or like device 
having a firebox defining a combustion zone (24). The 
burner assembly (20) includes a first annular tile (36) 
defining a centrally located path for a flow of combustion 
air and a second annular tile (38) concentric with the first 
annular tile. The second annular tile (38) has an internal 
diameter which is larger than an external diameter of said 
first annular tile (36), and the second annular tile (38) is 
positioned in surrounding relationship relative to at least a 
portion of said first annular tile (36) so that a ring-shaped 
conduit (80) is defined therebetween. The arrangement is 
such that combustion air flowing along said path induces 
a flow of flue gas through the conduit for entrainment by 
the flow of combustion air.
