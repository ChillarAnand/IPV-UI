International Classification => (71) 
Abstract => To provide a power supply apparatus 
for an electric vehicle wherein the insulation of a poer 
supply line for supplying a drive voltage to an electric 
motor can be simplified and the cost for the  insulation 
can be reduced. [solving means] A power supply 
apparatus for an electric vehicle includes batteries 1-1 
and 1-2 for driving a  motor 2 and general electric 
parts3. A node A of an intermediate voltage of 24 V 
between a drive voltage of 48 V of the batteries 1-1 and 
1-2 and the ground voltage is connected to a ground line 
for the general electric pats 3. an inverter 16 produces a 
voltage to be applied to the general electric parts 3 
absed on the drive voltage of 48 V of the batteries 1-1 
and 1-2 and the intermediates voltage of 24 v. by 
adjusting the duty ration of the inverter 16, a voltage of 
AC 24 V or, 12 V can be applied to the  general electric 
parts 3.
