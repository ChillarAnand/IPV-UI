Abstract => The present invention relates to a method for 
forming particles of a substance, comprising the 
step of introducting into a mixing chamber (8), in 
which the temperature and pressure are controlled, a 
fluid gas (4) and at least one vehicle system (1) 
comprising at least one substance in solution or 
suspension such that droplet formation and 
extraction of the vehicle occur substantially 
simultaneously by the action of the fluid gas (4). 
Turbulence is induced in at least one of said fluid 
gas (4) and said vehicle system (1) so as to create a 
controlled disorder in the flow of the at least one of 
the fluid gas (4) or the vehicle system (1) in order to 
control the particle formation in said mixing 
chamber (8), said controlled disorder being created 
by at least one flow perturbation means (11). The 
invention also relates to a mixing chamber having at 
least one flow perturbation means (11) that is 
disposed for interacting with at least one of a fluid 
gas (4) or vehicle system (1) supplied by the at least 
one supply member (4, 5) so as to induce turbulence 
or limited disorder in the at least one of the fluid gas 
(4) or vehicle system (1).
