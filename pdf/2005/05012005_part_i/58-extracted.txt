International Classification => (71) 
Abstract => To realize downsizing of an engine with motor ACG and suppress increment in friction due to excessive power generation. 
 
Magnet 18 are provided on an outer periphery of a driving-side pulley 11 of a V-belt continuously variable transmission thereby the pulley is used as a rotor 39 
of a motor ACG 33.  A stator 19 is provided around the rotor 39.  In accordance with increment in the number of engine revolutions, the position of the rotor 39 
to the stator 19, i.e., the position of a movable pulley member 112 changes and an area of the stator 19 opposite to the rotor 39 is reduced, thus the rate of 
increment in power generation amount is reduced.
