Abstract => The present invention relates to a method for producing a mammalian heparin-binding protein in 
a mammalian cell that can be cultured under anaerobic conditions after introducing a nucleic acid encoding as 
heparin-binding protein into said cell with comprising (a) introducing into said mammalian cell a nucleic acid 
encoding said heparin-binding protein; (b) culturing the cell of step (a) under conditions conducive to 
expression of said HBP; and (c) recovering said HBP from the culture medium.  Furthermore, the invention 
relates to the recombinant mammalian cell used in the method.
