Abstract => A clamshell coupling (12) for a conduit 
system (10) is provided. The clamshell 
coupling may comprise at least one 
longitudinal housing (50a, 50b) having first 
and second ends (56, 58) adapted to receive 
sections of conduit (32, 34). A restraint 
system may be disposed on an interior 
surface (54) of the longitudinal housing. 
The restraint system operates to actively 
engage at least one conduit and resist a 
longitudinal load between the clamshell 
coupling and the conduit. A coupling 
system (88, 89) may be used to secure the 
longitudinal housings to the tubular 
members.
