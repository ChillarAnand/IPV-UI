Abstract => A cylindrical glass body having a low water content 
centerline region and method of manufacturing such a 
cylindrical glass body for use in the manufacture of 
optical waveguide fiber is disclosed. The centerline 
region of the cylindrical glass body has a water content 
sufficiently low such that an optical waveguide fiber 
made from the cylindrical glass body of the present 
invention exhibits an optical attenuation of less than 
about 0.35 dB/km, and preferably less than about 0.31 
dB/km at a measured wavelength of 1380nm. A low 
water content plug (46, 54) used in the manufacture of 
such a cylindrical glass body, an optical waveguide fiber 
having a low water peak, and an optical fiber 
communication system incorporating such an optical 
waveguide fiber is also disclosed.
