Title => PROCESS AND SYSTEM FOR MANAGING ALTITUDE FOR AN  
                                       AERODYNE USING THE AUTOMATIC CAPTURE OF A BAROMETRIC  
                                       ALTITUDE OR OF A RADIOPROBE HEIGHT 
 

International Classification => G 05 D 1/04 (71) 
Abstract => The invention concerns a system and a method for 
controlling the altitude of a heavier-than-air aircraft 
which consists in particular in: selecting and 
displaying a set altitude; acquiring the manoeuvring 
altitude of the aircraft, in particular with first 
measuring means corresponding to a barometric 
mode and second radio sonde measuring means 
corresponding to a radio sonde mode; bringing the 
manoeuvring altitude of the aircraft to the set 
altitude corresponding to a step for automatic 
altitude capture; switching the set altitude from the 
barometric mode to the radio sonde mode or from 
the radio sonde mode to the barometric mode when 
said set altitude is lower or respectively higher than 
an altitude defined according to the barometric 
mode.
