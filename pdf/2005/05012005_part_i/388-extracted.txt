Abstract => The invention relates to a method for producing ABS molding materials. According to this 
method, a solution containing rubber is produced first and the polymerization for producing the ABS molding 
compounds is then carried out in the presence of this solution containing rubber. Said solution containing 
rubber is produced by polymerizing diolefines in a solution of vinylaromatic monomers, in the presence of a 
catalyst containing the following: (a) at least one compound of the rare earth metals; (b) at least one organo-
aluminum compound; and (c) optionally, a Lewis acid.
