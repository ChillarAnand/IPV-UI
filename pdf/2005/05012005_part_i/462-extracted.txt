Abstract => An electronic device cabinet for an 
electronic device is provided with a cover and an 
engaging member that holds the cover in a closed state. 
The engaging member has an integrally formed 
impelling member that acts upon the engaging member 
and furthers the interengagement with said cover. The 
integrally formed engagement member and impelling 
member can be attached to the cabinet in a simple 
maneuver, thereby simplifying the overall assembly of 
the electronic device cabinet.
