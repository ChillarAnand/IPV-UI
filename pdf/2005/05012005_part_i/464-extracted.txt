Abstract => A process for producing a phenoxyphosphazene compound which comprises treating a 
phenoxyphosphazene compound with either (a) at least one adsorbent selected among activated carbon, silica gel, 
activated alumina, activated clay, synthetic zeolites, and high-molecular adsorbents or (b) at least one reactant 
selected among metal/hydrogen complex compounds, hydrazine, hypochlorites, thiosulfates, dialkyl sulfates, 
orthoesters, diazoalkanes, lactones, alkanesultones, epoxy compounds, and hydrogen peroxide or with (c) both of 
the adsorbent and the reactant. Incorporation of the phenoxyphosphazene compound produced by the process into 
a synthetic resin has the following advantages. The synthetic resin can be inhibited from changing in color. When 
the resultant resin composition is stored over long, it has intact properties of the synthetic resin, such as heat 
resistance, weatherability, unsusceptibility to discoloration, and chemical resistance. The resin composition gives a 
molding having satisfactory properties imparted thereto, such as flame retardancy, thermal stability, and 
moldability.
