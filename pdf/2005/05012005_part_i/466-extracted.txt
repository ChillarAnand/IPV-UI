Abstract => An electronic device having a cabinet formed 
from two halves that are joined together have provided 
therein multiple boards that are stacked and housed. 
The joining of the cabinet halves secures the boards in 
position within the cabinet and assures electrical 
continuity between boards, such that the positioning and 
arrangement of the boards within the cabinet upon 
assembly of the cabinet is not compromised by the 
cabinet being moved or flipped over.
