Title => METHODS OF EXTRACTING CATALYST FROM A REACTION  
                                     MIXTURE IN THE OXIDATION OF CYCLOHEXANE TO ADIPIC ACID 
 

International Classification => C 07 C 51/31,  
Abstract => This invention  relates to methods of controlling the oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid in the 
presence of a monobasic acid solvent by extracting the catalyst from the reaction mixture, outside the 
reaction zone. Substantially all the unreacted cyclohexane, the majority of adipic acid, and preferably 
substantially all the monobasic acid solvent are preferably removed from the reaction product. In the 
case that substantially all the monobasic acid solvent is removed, protic solvent, is added 
intermittently or continuously in the reaction mixture during the removal of the monobasic acid 
solvent, preferably by distillation, for preventing solids precipitation. Dipolar aprotic solvent is then 
added in the presence of an adequate amount of the protic solvent (the total of dipolar aprotic solvent 
and the protic solvent constituting a novel combination solvent) to maintain a single liquid phase, 
followed by a step of extracting substantially all the catalyst in protic solvent. The catalyst extract is 
preferably recycled to the reaction zone, where the cyclohexane is oxidized to adipic acid.  Thus the 
novel combination solvent, which is preferably a combination of cyclohexanone with water, allows 
the dissolution of the reaction product, preferably after removal of the majority of the adipic acid, 
followed by a substantially complete extraction of the catalyst in water.  No catalyst precipitation 
takes place, and all disadvantages and costs of solids handling are prevented.
