Abstract => Q is - N=or CR2; X is S, O or NOR3; Y is-O-, -S-, -SO- or -SO2-; 
R and R1 are each, independently, H, a substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic, 
aromatic, heteroaromatic or aralkyl group R2 is H or a substituent; R3 is H, or -
C(O)R4; R4 is a substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic or aromatic group; n is an 
integer from 0 to 1. Chemical compounds having structural formula (I) and 
physiologically acceptable salts thereof, are inhibitors of serine/threonine and 
tyrosine kinase activity. Several of the tyrosine kinases, whose activity is 
inhibited by these chemical compounds, are involved in angiogenic processes. 
Thus, these chemical compounds can ameliorate disease states where 
angiogenesis or endothelial cell hyperproliferation is a factor. These compounds 
can be used to treat cancer and hyperproliferative disorders.
