Abstract => Update of a master key and a media key is 
transmitted along with a key update block (KRB) through a 
key distribution system of tree structure.  The KRB bas a 
structure where devices constituting leaves of the tree 
have a leaf key and a limited node key and creates and 
distributes a specific key update block (KRB) to a group 
specified by a specific node, thereby limiting updateable 
devices.  Any device not belonging to the group cannot 
decode the data, thus ensuring the safety of key 
distribution.  Especially, in a system using a master key 
under generation control, an update master key is 
distributed by a KRB.
