Abstract => The present invention provides a data processing system for performing an arithmetic operation on a 
plurality “p” of signed “n-bit” data values, and a method of operating such a data processing system.  
The technique of the present invention involves encoding the plurality of signed n-bit data values as 
a composite value comprising p n-bit fields by performing an encoding operation equivalent to 
aligning each signed data value with a respective n-bit field, sign extending each signed data value to 
the most significant bit of the composite value, and adding the aligned and sign extended data values 
to form the composite value.  Then the arithmetic operation is applied to the composite value to 
produce an encoded result comprising p n-bit fields, and the encoded result is decoded to produce p 
final results by applying a decoding operation equivalent to extracting the data from each n-bit field 
of the encoded result and correcting for any effect caused by the addition of an adjacent sign 
extended data value during the encoding step, whereby each final result represents the application of 
the arithmetic operation to a corresponding signed n-bit data value.  In accordance with the present 
invention, two or more signed data values are encoded into a composite value, and the composite 
value is then processed using standard instructions as if they were SIMD instructions.  This is made 
possible by use of a particular encoding of the signed data values which avoids the problems with 
overflow and underflow between two adjacent data values.  Since this encoding enables standard 
instructions to be used, much of the benefits of using SIMD extensions can be achieved without the 
cost of extra hardware or new instructions which SMID techniques necessitate.
