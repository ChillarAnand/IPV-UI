Abstract => A roller guide assembly (18) is disclosed for guiding a workpiece into a roll pass of a rolling mill. The guide assembly 
comprises: a rigid housing structure; a pair of roller holders (26) extending lengthwise of the housing structure on 
opposite sides of the intended direction of travel of the workpiece; guide rollers (28) rotatably carried on the roller 
holders (26), the guide rollers (28) defining a gap therebetween and being configured to engage and guide the 
workpiece into the roll pass of the rolling mill; pivots (30) for mounting the roller holders (26) on the housing 
structure for movement about axes extending generally parallel to the rotational axes of the guide rollers (28); springs 
(32) for applying forces to the roller holders (26) to rotate the roller holders (26) about their respective axes in 
directions urging the guide rollers (28) apart; and stops on the housing structure for resisting rotation of the roller 
holders, at least one of the stops acting through a force sensor (38) to provide a measure of the force being applied to 
the respective roller holder (26). (FIG.: 2)
