Abstract => The present invention relates to a glass article for use 
as an optical waveguide fiber (1), the core (4) of 
which is doped with a chalcogenide element to 
significantly increase the refractive index of the core 
(4). The subject of this invention is novel doped silica 
core composition wherein a portion of the oxygen in 
the silica is replaced with either sulfur, selenium or 
tellurium using plasma enhanced chemical vapor 
deposition (PECVD). These compositions are 
designed to have higher refractive indices than silica, 
low coefficient of expansion, high optical 
transparency and appropriate viscosity and softening 
points to make them ideal candidates for use as optical 
waveguide fibers.
