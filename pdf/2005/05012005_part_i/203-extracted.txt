                                       LIGNIN CONTENT 
 

International Classification => C 12 N 9/00,  
Abstract => Novel isolated polynucleotides and polypeptides associated with the lignin biosynthetic pathway are 
provided, together with constructs including such sequences.  Methods for the modulation of lignin 
structure and lignin composition in target organisms are also disclosed, the methods comprising 
incorporating one or more of the polynucleotides of the present invention into the genome of a target 
organism.
