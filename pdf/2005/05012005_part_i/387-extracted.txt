Abstract => A method for controlling corrosion of metals, such as stainless steel, in contact with an aqueous system 
which comprises introducing into said system at least one tetrazolium compound of formula (I) wherein R1, R2 and R3 
are selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, branched lower alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, alkylaryl, substituted 
alkylaryl and heterocyclic substituted aryl, with the proviso that neither R1, R2, or R3 contain more than 14 carbon atoms; 
and n is 1 or 2, such tetrazolium compound optionally having associated water soluble ionic species if needed to obtain a 
neutral charge.
