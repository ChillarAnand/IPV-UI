Abstract => Rapid screening for activities and selectivities of 
catalyst libraries having addressable test sites is 
achieved by contacting potential catalysts at the test 
sites with reactant streams forming product plumes at 
the addressable test sites. The product plumes are 
screened by translating a sample probe and/or the 
library to a position that one addressable site is in 
proximity to the sampling probe sample orifice and 
passing a portion of the reaction products through the 
sampling orifice forming a free jet expanded volume 
in at least one vacuum stage and passing a portion of 
the cooled and reduced pressure jet stream through 
an inlet orifice of a mass spectrometer for analysis. 
The mass spectrometric analysis may be combined 
with resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization 
methods of detection for very rapid library 
evaluation. Suitable reactors, microreactors, and 
product transfer sample microprobes for product 
transfer to a mass spectrometer are disclosed.
