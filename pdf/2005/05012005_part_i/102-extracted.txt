Abstract => A process for the production of an amine salt of clavulanic acid and the conversion thereof 
into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof has been provided.  During the crystallization 
phase of the amine salt of clavulanic acid either a clavulanic acid containing solution, optionally with a 
cosolvent, is added to the amine or both reactants are added together to a cristallisation vessel.  Also the 
application of a temperature profile (decreasing in time), profile of speed of addition (increasing in time) 
and a profile of the ratio amine/clavulanic acid (increasing in time) for this cristallisation process has been 
provided for.
