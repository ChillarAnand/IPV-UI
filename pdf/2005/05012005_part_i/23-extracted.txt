Title => COLOR ILLUMINATION SYSTEM FOR SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATORS USING MULTIPLE DOUBLE TELECENTRIC RELAYS. 
       

International Classification => (71) 
Abstract => A digital projection apparatus (10) for projection of a multicolor image uniformizes polychromatic light from a light source (12) and 
provides magnification to the uniformized illumination beam using a base condenser relay (80), providing a reduced numerical aperture for conditioning 
at a dichroic separator (27). For each monochromatic component color provided from the dichroic separator (27), a reducing relay (82) then demagnifies 
the illumination beam to provide source illumination to a spatial light modulator (30) at an increased numerical aperture. As a result, color shading 
across the field is minimized and brightness is optimized.
