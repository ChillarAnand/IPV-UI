Abstract => An improved network flow system includes an 
Internet/intranet enabled network flow computer with 
at least one flow measurement device and a host 
computer capable of communicating using Internet 
technology or through local connection to the flow 
computer. In one embodiment, the Internet enabled 
network flow computer receives flow measurement 
data, in raw or calculated form, from one or more 
measurement devices. The host computer connects to 
the network flow computer via the Internet, an intranet 
or local connections. The host computer transmits or 
receives data from the network flow computer, 
including the capability to view flow data results in 
web page format on the host computer and the 
capability to remotely or locally configure and control 
the flow computer from the host computer.
