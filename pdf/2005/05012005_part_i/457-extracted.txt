Abstract => The invention relates to a roller support 
system for supporting a rotatingly driven tubular body so 
that it can be tilted, axially displaced and rotated. The 
inventive roller support system comprises two rollers 
that are disposed symmetrically on both sides of the 
longitudinal center plane of a vertical tubular body and 
that are received by two pivot bearings that are fastened 
so as to be tilted on a bearing plate that is supported on 
a stationary foundation. The aim of the invention is to 
allow for an optimum and smooth self-adjustment of 
every roller. To this end, every bearing plate is 
supported on the foundation via two pivot bearings that 
are disposed at a transversal distance to each other. 
The inner pivot bearing is configured as a ball-joint 
bearing and is stationary fastened on the foundation 
while the outer pivot bearing is configured as a free 
bearing and is supported on the foundation to be 
slideably movable about the joint center of the inner 
pivot bearing.
