Abstract => R3-O-R4 (2) 
 
A novel process for producing homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene which involves contacting 
ethylene and/or ethylene and at least one or more other olefin(s) under polymerization conditions 
with a Ziegler-Natta type catalyst containing at least one or more internal electron donors, 
trimethylaluminum and at least one or more external electron donors containing at least one carbon-
oxygen-carbon linkage (C-O-C) selected from the group consisting of Formula (1), R1-CH2-O-CH2-
R2, Formula (2), Formula (3), R5-O-R6, and Formula (4), R7-O(-R8-O)n-R9. Also provided are films 
and articles produced therefrom.
