Abstract => Audit data collected at a retail establishment 
pertains to a plurality of purchases. For each purchase, an 
associated purchase date and an associated number of 
purchased units is determined. For each purchase date, a 
depletion rate is determined that will cause the number of 
purchased units to be depleted upon the occurrence of the 
next successive purchase date. The depletion rate is an 
estimation of daily sales occurring between successive 
purchase dates. Causal data may also be collected at the 
retail establishment, which is considered to be valid during 
a causal audit period. Total estimated sales occurring 
during the causal audit period are determined by summing 
the estimated daily sales for each purchase date within the 
causal audit period. Relationships may be identified 
between the causal data and the total estimated sales during 
the causal audit period. If a relationship between the causal 
data and the total estimated sales is identified, one or more 
marketing strategies may be developed for taking 
advantage of the identified relationship. Marketing 
strategies may be analyzed using one or more analytical 
marketing models to determine whether any of the 
marketing strategies are viable. Any marketing strategies 
that are determined to be viable may be implemented in the 
retail environment. At a later time, updated audit data and 
causal data may be collected and analyzed in the above-
described manner for the purpose of monitoring the 
performance of the one or more implemented marketing 
strategies.
