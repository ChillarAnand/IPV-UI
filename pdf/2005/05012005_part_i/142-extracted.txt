Title => POLYVINYLIDENE DIFLUORIDE MEMBRANES AND METHODS FOR  
                                       MAKING SUCH MEMBRANES 
 

International Classification => B 01 D 71/28 (71) 
Abstract => Microporous membranes (10) comprising polyvinylidene difluoride and methods for making such 
membranes are disclosed. The membranes (10), which are not crosslinked and are not contacted with a 
strong alkali solution during manufacture, are wettable by aqueous solution even after repeated wetting and 
drying. The membrane includes a support (18) and surfaces (11) treated with a hydrophilic coating. 
Separately, such membranes are also useful in apparatus (60) for separating a biological fluid into two or 
more components.
