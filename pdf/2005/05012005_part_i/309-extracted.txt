Abstract => A tundish impact pad formed from refractory 
material is disclosed, the impact pad comprising a 
base having an impact surface which in use faces 
upwardly to receive molten metal, e.g. steel, 
poured onto the impact pad, and a sidewall 
extending upwardly from at least part of the 
periphery of the impact surface. At least part of 
the interior, and a surface, of the sidewall are 
porous and the impact pad includes means for 
supplying a gas, e.g. argon, to the porous interior 
of the sidewall, to enable the gas to be supplied to 
the molten metal from the porous surface of the 
sidewall. The tundish impact pad may be used 
during the continuous casting of steel.
