Abstract => A method is provided for simulating at least one 
characteristic of a physical system. The physical 
sytem is discretized into a plurality of 
volumetric cells (201-215) having boundaries 
therebetween. An initial estimate of state 
variables is assigned for each cell. For each cell, 
linear equations are constructed relating its state 
variables to the state variables of cells adjacent 
to it. A transportability value is associated with 
each boundary and the boundaries are ranked 
corresponding to descending transportability 
values. The boundary rankings are used to 
construct topologically one-dimensional strings 
of cells (50, 51). A matrix equation for each 
string is constructed by assembling the linear 
equations associated with the cells for each 
string. Improved estimates of the state variables 
of the cells are determined by solving the matrix 
equations. These state variables are then used to 
simulate at least one characteristic of the 
physical system.
