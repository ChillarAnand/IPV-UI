Title => BATTERY PACK HAVING A STATE OF CHARGE INDICATOR 
 

International Classification => G 01 R 31/36 (71) 
Abstract => A battery pack (10) for a portable electronic device includes a case (12) for carrying a battery (36). The case 
(12) supports a charge sensing circuit (20) carried by the case, the charge sensing circuit producing a 
discharge signal corresponding to a measurement of an amount of charge removed from a battery. The case 
also supports a processor (22) responsive to the discharge signal from the charge sensor circuit to produce a 
signal corresponding to an amount of time prior to discharge of the battery based on a current rate of 
discharge and a display (14) responsive to the signal to display a time period corresponding to the amount of 
time to discharge the battery based upon the current rate of discharge of the battery.
