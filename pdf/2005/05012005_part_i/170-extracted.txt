Title => BULB HAVING INTERIOR SURFACE COATED WITH RARE EARTH  
                                       OXIDE 
 

International Classification => H 01 J 17/16, 17/20 (71) 
Abstract => A lamp bulb (1) includes a light transmissive 
envelope (2), a fill material disposed inside the 
envelope including a rare earth metal which forms 
a plasma discharge when excited, and a coating (3) 
disposed on an interior surface of the envelope 
which inhibits reaction between the plasma 
discharge and the envelope (2), wherein the coating 
(3) comprises an oxide of the same rare earth metal 
of the fill material. A process for coating the 
interior of a lamp bulb envelope (2) includes 
preparing a sol gel solution having a precursor of 
the desired coating, introducing the sol gel solution 
into a lamp preform, distributing the sol gel along 
an interior surface of the bulb, and drying and 
firing the sol gel to obtain the coated bulb.
