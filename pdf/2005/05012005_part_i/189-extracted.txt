Title => METHOD FOR PRODUCING PURE MELAMINE 
 

International Classification => C 07 D 251/62,  
Abstract => The invention relates to a method for producing pure melamine.  According to this method, the 
melamine melt, which is produced from urea in a high-pressure process, is cooled and ammonia is 
added until it reaches a temperature of approximately 1 to 500 C  above the melting temperature of 
the melamine as dependent on the respective pressure of ammonia and then either a) quenched with 
water or an aqueous solution or suspension containing ammonia and/or melamine so that the 
melamine solidifies or b) quenches with cold liquid or gaseous ammonia, so that the melamine 
solidifies, the melamine then being cooled further with water or an aqueous solution or suspension 
containing ammonia and/or melamine and c) the melamine is then isolated.
