Abstract => Filament in tube and stick in tube 
processes of forming optical fiber are described. A 
solid or monolithic core feedstock (110) is disposed 
in a hollow cladding structure (112) to form a 
loosely filled cladding structure. The filled cladding 
structure is heated to a draw temperature 
approximately equal to the softening temperature of 
the cladding structure. The feedstock (110) melts 
and fills the heated portion of the cladding structure 
forming a filled core which can then be drawn into 
optical fiber or to an optical can which can then be 
further overclad consolidated and drawn into fiber. 
Feedstock (110) and cladding structures (112) 
having widely varying coefficients of expansion 
may be employed. The resulting fiber can be readily 
designed to be fused to existing installed fibers.
