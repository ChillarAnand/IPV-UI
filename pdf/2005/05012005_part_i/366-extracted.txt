Abstract => Method and apparatus for enhancing the 
performance of a network. The performance 
enhancing functions described are applicable 
to a wide variety of communication links, 
including both slow and fast links, high 
latency links, and links with low and high 
error rates. The performance enhancing 
functions, which may be implemented either 
singly or in combination, include selective 
spoofing which allows flexible configuration 
of which connections should be spoofed, 
spoofing of the conventional TCP three-way 
handshake, local data acknowledgement, 
which allows data windows to increase at local 
speeds, multiplexing multiple connections 
across a single connection, data 
compression/encryption, prioritization, and 
path selection. The performance enhancing 
features described are particularly useful for 
links with high latency and/or high bit error 
rates.
