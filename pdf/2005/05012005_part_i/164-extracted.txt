Abstract => A synthetic method for the preparation of the anti-tumor drug Etoposide. In one 
embodiment, the method includes the direct condensation of 4'-demethyl epipodophylloxin with 2,3-di-O-
dichloroacetyl-(4,6-O-ethylidene)-  -D-glucopyranose in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethane 
sulfonate (TMSOTf) to yield 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin-4-(2,3-di-O-dichloroacetyl-4,6-0-
ethylidene)-  -D-glucopyranoside, followed by conversion of the same to etoposide. Other methods 
include use of different Lewis acids as catalyst, as well as different substituted glucopyranosides. This 
method provides enhanced yields over existing synthetic techniques, reduced reaction times and permits 
more favorable isolation reaction procedures.
