Abstract => An improved bulk storage system for fluids supplied to 
a dispensing system (270) by a fluid line (280). The 
bulk storage system includes a receptacle (110) with a 
first portal and a second portal. A substantially 
nonpermeable bag (200) is positioned within the 
receptacle for storing and dispensing fluids therefrom. 
The bag includes a first passageway positioned 
adjacent to the first portal of the receptacle and a 
second passageway positioned adjacent to the second 
portal of the receptacle. A support device (170) is 
positioned adjacent to the receptacle. The first 
passageway of the bag is attached to the support device 
and the second passageway of the bag is attached to the 
fluid line (280) such that fluids in the bag flow through 
the second passageway to the dispensing system.
