Title => MAMMALIAN SERINE RACEMASE. 
 

International Classification => C 12 N 15/61 (71) 
Abstract => High levels of D-serine occur in mammalian brain, where it appears to be an endogenous 
ligand of the “glycine site” of NMDA receptors.  We have purified from rat brain a soluble enzyme that 
catalyzes the direct recemization of L-serine to D-serine.  Purified serine racemase has a molecular weight 
of 37 kDa and requires pyridoxal 5’-phosphate for its activity.  The enzyme is highly selective toward L-
serine, falling to racemize any other amino acid tested.  We have also identified polynucleotide sequences 
which encode mammalian, including human, serine racemase.  Compounds which modulate the activity of 
mammalian serine racemase are useful for treating conditions and diseases which involve overstimulation 
of NMDA receptors, such as stroke and various neurodegenerative diseases.
