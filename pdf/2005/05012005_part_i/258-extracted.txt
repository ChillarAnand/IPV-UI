Title => REACTION MONITORING. 
 

International Classification => G 01 N 21/65 (71) 
Abstract => This invention relates to a method for monitoring a 
chemical reaction of pharmaceutical relevance, 
comprising the steps of: consecutively obtaining Raman 
spectrum samples of a solution of chemical constituents 
contained within a reaction vessel, by irradiating, with 
substantially monochromatic radiation, said solution and 
detecting the scattered radiation; processing said Raman 
spectrum samples by means of a multivariate data 
analysis (MVDA) for consecutively generating at least a 
first main component related to a latent variable 
indicative of the progress of the reaction wherein the 
multivariate data analysis is independent from 
calibration using reference measurements of objects 
having a known composition; and determining the extent 
of the chemical reaction on basis of said at least a first 
main component and optionally on basis of additionally 
one or more main components generated from one or 
more previously run reactions of the same kind.
