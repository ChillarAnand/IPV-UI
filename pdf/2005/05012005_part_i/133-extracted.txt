Title => CONTINUOUS PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF  
                                       ANHYDROSUGAR ALCOHOLS 
 

International Classification => C 07 D 307/02 (71) 
Abstract => A process is described for continuous production of anhydrosugar alcohols by continuous 
introducing of sugar alcohols and/or monoanhydrosugar alcohols into a reaction vessel and 
dehydration in the presence of an acid catalyst and solvent, preferably an organic solvent, in which 
the resultant reaction products are soluble.  Water and the organic solvent having the dissolved 
reaction product are each continuously removed from the reaction chamber.  The reaction product is 
separated from the removed solvent, which is recycled into the reaction vessel.  The reaction product 
is optionally purified by distillation and/or recrystallization.  The purified reaction product obtained 
is particularly suitable as a starting product for producing polymers, and has a purity of at least 
99.0%.
