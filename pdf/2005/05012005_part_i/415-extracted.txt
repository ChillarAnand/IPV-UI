Abstract => There is provided a catalyst containing porous macrostructures comprised of: (a) a three-dimensional 
network of particles of porous inorganic material; and, (b) at least one metal. The particles of the at least one 
macrostructure occupy less than 75 % of the total volume of the at least one macrostructure and are jointed together to 
form a three-dimensional interconnected network. The three-dimensional interconnected network will usually be 
comprised of pores having diameters greater than about 20 ANGSTROM . The macrostructures can be made by forming 
an admixture containing a porous organic ion exchanger and a synthesis mixture capable of forming the porous inorganic 
material and the at least one metal; converting the synthesis mixture to the porous inorganic material; and removing the 
porous organic ion exchanger from the organic material. The metal-containing macrostructures find application in 
hydrocarbon conversion and in the reduction of emissions.
