Abstract => A barge unloading system by which a barge having semi closed plurality of hoppers 
containing granular materials is rapidly unloaded by raising the barge height by floating on rising water 
level and then tilting it to discharge its contents through its material outlet ports in to a material receiving 
silo /dumped on the ground. 
 
The said floating barge is parked & isolated inside a barge raising compartment connected to main water 
body. Said compartment along with its extension compartment, called the barge tilting compartment, is 
flooded with water pumped by a water pumping system. 
The barge is raised to the required height & towed in to extended compartment & isolated from the barge 
raising compartment.  
 
Flood water is drained from said barge tilting compartment to allow the barge to get lowered & rest as 
well as get anchored in the inclined barge seat, which is integral to said barge tilting compartment. 
 
All the gates of the barge & the barge seat are opened to dump the barge content. Once the barge is empty, 
all the gates & water drain valves are closed before flooding the compartments. 
 
The barge is brought to floating condition by flooding the compartment & towed back to previous 
compartment & the flood water is fully from to bring down the barge to the main water body level before 
letting it out of the barge raising compartment in to main water body.
