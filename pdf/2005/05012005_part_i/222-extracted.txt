Title => PAGE RESPONSE ON EXISTING RADIO SIGNALING CHANNEL 
 

International Classification => H 04 Q 7/38 (71) 
Abstract => When a mobile terminal in a mobile radio 
network has a user data connection established 
to a core network node, and receives a page 
message on a paging channel from a second core 
network node to which the terminal has no data 
connection established, the mobile terminal can 
send a page response message to the second core 
network node on the existing signaling channel 
between the mobile terminal and the radio access 
network associated with the established data 
connection to that core network node. The page 
response then triggers a multiplexing between 
the mobile terminal and radio access network, of 
the established connection with the first core 
network node and the desired call connection 
(precipitated by the page request) from the 
second core network node. This way, the mobile 
station can receive simultaneous calls from two 
different core network nodes over a common 
traffic and signaling connection.
