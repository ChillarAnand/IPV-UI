Abstract => A communication system balances message traffic between return channel groups and within 
the groups, so that the user does not control the specific transmission frequency used. Uplink frequencies and 
bandwidths for the return channels are set by the system in a return channel control message in the broadcast 
signal so as to account for system and return channel group laoding, and to account for user message 
backlogs. An initial transmission from a remote user may be made using an ALOHA-type burst signal that 
provides a message backlog to the control station, and is made on a frequency determined from a randomly 
weighted, load-based frequency selection process. The system, and not the individual users determine the 
frequency and channel allocations. For large backlogs or priority users, periodic bandwidth is provided. A 
method for balancing loads among and between groups of return channels in the communication system 
includes requesting return channel bandwidth in an uplink message from a remote user to a control station. 
The uplink message may include both a backlog indicator and a bandwidth allocation request provided to a 
Network Operations Center (NOC) which can be used to set the return channel bandwidth and frequency for 
the remote uplink. A user message is transmitted on the designated return channel frequency using bandwidth 
allocated in accordance with the backlog indicator and a bandwidth allocation request so that traffic loads are 
maintained in balance between established return channel frequency groups, and within each return channel 
frequency group.
