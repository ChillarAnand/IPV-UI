Title => IMPROVEMENT IN GEAR SHIFTING SYSTEM OF 2 OR 3 WHEELED VEHICLES. 
       

International Classification => B 60 K 041/06 (71) 
Abstract => An improved gear shifting system for 2 or 3 wheeled vehicles having a handle bar steering control and hand operated gearshift control 
located on left hand side of the handle bar comprising an outside gear cable (43a), an inside gear cable (43), housing (26) and integral boss (47 and 47a), bolt 
(31), a drum actuator (32), a lever drum (33) with two sets of axial slots (set no 1 as N2, A2, B2, C2, D2 and set no 2 as N3, A3, B3, C2 and D3), a slider block 
(34), a fixed drum (35) having integral collar (35a) and slots (S1 and S2), a first circlip (36), pin (37), return spring (38), guide (39), cable adjuster (42 and 
42a), means to avoid friction such as needle bush (45), sector plate assembly (46) with hole (H1) comprising of a sector plate upper (46d), a distance piece 
(46a), a sector plate lower (46b) with an integral lug (29a), sleeve (46a), pawls (40 and 40a), pawl spring (41), the other end of each of said outside gear cable 
(43a) and inside gear (43) are assembled through cable adjuster (42a and 42) to the sector plate assembly (46); the sector plate assembly (46) is guided and 
supported on a means to avoid friction such as needle bush (45) which is press fitted in said housing (26); said drum actuator (32) assembled with sector 
plate assembly (46) and fastened together with a bolt (31), said two pawls (40 and 40a) are assembled along with pawl spring (41) in a square slot provided 
at a predetermined position stransverse to the axis of drum actuator (32), said lever drum (33) is assembled over said drum actuator (32) along with a fixed 
drum (35) having an integral collar (35a) and held in position by a first circlip (36), the collar (35a) protrudes in the angular space between the drum 
actuator (32) and lever drum (33), two pawls (40 and 40a) project out of the cylindrical portion of the drum actuator (32) due to compression of pawl 
springs (41); the collar (35a) is provided with angular slots (S1 and S2) and the fixed drum (35) is held in position with respect to housing (26) with the help 
of a pin (37), the slider block (34) is guided in the hole in the lever drum (33) and engaged in the cavity of stem (62), return spring (38) is freely positioned on 
the outer periphery of guide (39) which is assembled onto the housing (26) located below the sector plate assembly (46) with spring arms resting on boss (47) 
and lug (29a); the said torsion spring (79) and the said return spring (38) enabling the twist grip (77) to return to reset (home) position after selection of the 
desired gear position by the rider.
