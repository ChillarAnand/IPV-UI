Abstract => The invention provides a detergent tablet of compacted particulate composition 
containing : (a) particles which contain organic surfactant together with detergency builder, and (b) 
water-insoluble but water-swellable particles of plant material which contain both cellulose and lignin, 
obtainable by fragmentation of plant material without separation of its fibers into a liquid dispersion.  
Also provided is a process of making this tablet which comprises mixing water-insoluble, water-
swellable disintegration-promoting material as defined above with other particulate ingredients so as to 
form a particulate detergent composition and compacting a quantity of the particulate composition in a 
mould so that it forms a tablet or a region of a tablet.  The detergent tablets exhibit good disintegration 
together with adequate mechanical strength.
