Title => SLURRIES OF ABRASIVE INORGANIC OXIDE PARTICLES AND  
                                      METHOD FOR ADJUSTING THE ABRASIVENESS OF THE PARTICLES 
 

International Classification => C 09 G 1/02, 
Abstract => Autoclaving slurries of porous, inorganic oxide particles results in an increased abrasiveness of the 
particles as reflected in increased removal rates of a polished substrate at standard polishing 
conditions in chemical mechanical polishing operations. Slurries having novel abrasion properties, 
especially for silica-based slurries, are created. The increase in particle abrasivity strongly correlates 
with a decrease in particle surface area as determined by N2 adsorption (BET method). As a result, 
methods for obtaining a desired abrasivity for a slurry can be practiced by heating a slurry of 
inorganic oxide particles to a BET surface area previously identified as associated with the abrasivity 
desired.  The resulting slurries can be used in conventional polishing machinery.  The method is 
particularly suitable for preparing silica-based abrasive slurries.
