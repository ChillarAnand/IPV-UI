Title => USE OF A FORMULATION FOR CONTROLLING EXPRESSION OF A  
                                       TARGET GENE 
 

International Classification => A 01 N 25/30 (71) 
Abstract => The use of a formulation comprising the components: (a) a volatile chemical inducer;  (b) a 
polyethoxylated C10-C20 alcohol or a trisiloxane polyethoxylate and (c) a diluent; for controlling 
expression of a target gene in a plant having a chemically-inducible plant gene expression cassette 
comprising an inducible promoter operatively linked to the target gene wherein the inducible 
promoter is induced by the application to the plant of (a) above.  Certain novel formulations are also  
claimed.
