                                       AND AN NMDA ANTAGONIST 
 

International Classification => A 61 K 31/485 (71) 
Abstract => A topical opioid paradigm was developed to determine analgesic peripheral effects of morphine. 
Topical morphine as well as peptides such as [D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly(ol)5]enkephalin (DAMGO) 
produced a potent, dose-dependent analgesia using the radiant heat tailflick assay. The topical drugs 
potentiated systemic agents, similar to the previously established synergy between peripheral and 
central sites of action. Local tolerance was rapidly produced by repeated daily topical exposure to 
morphine. Topical morphine tolerance was effectively blocked by the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate 
(NMDA) receptors antagonist MK801 and ketamine given either systemically or topically. NMDA 
receptor antagonists reversed pre-existing morphine tolerance. The activity of topical NMDA 
antagonists to block local morphine tolerance suggests that peripheral NMDA receptors mediate 
topical morphine tolerance. Morphine was cross tolerant to [D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly(ol)5]enkephalin 
(DAMGO), but not to morphine-6 beta -glucuronide, implying different mechanisms of action. 
These observations have great importance in the design and use of opioids clinically. Topical 
pharmaceutical compositions comprising an analgesic that functions through an opiate receptor and 
an NMDA receptor antagonist for producing analgesia without inducing tolerance are described.
