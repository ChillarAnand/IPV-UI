Abstract => A method is provided for scaling up permeabilities associated with 
a fine-scale grid of cells representative of a porous medium (fig.1) to 
permeabilities associated with an unstructured coarse-scale grid of cells 
representative of the porous medium (fig.3). An areally unstructured, Voronoi, 
computational grid is generated using the coarse-scale grid as the genesis of the 
computational grid. The computational grid is then populated with permeabilities 
associated with the fine-scale grid. Flow equations are developed for the 
computational grid, the flow equations are solved, and inter-node fluxes and 
pressure gradients are then computed for the computational grid. These inter-
node fluxes and pressure gradients are used to calculate inter-node average 
fluxes and average pressure gradients associated with the coarse-scale grid. The 
inter-node average fluxes and average pressure gradients associated with the 
coarse grid are then used to calculate upscaled permeabilities associated with the 
coarse-scale grid.
