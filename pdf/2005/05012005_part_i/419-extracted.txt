Abstract => An effective key block (EKB) used for 
key distribution structure of tree structure is re-
structured to a simplified two-branch or multi-branch 
tree in which a decodable end node or leaf is at the 
lowest layer so as to create a re-structured layered tree 
according to only a key corresponding to the node or 
leaf of the re-structured layered tree. A tag as 
identification data about the tree position of an 
encryption key stored in the EKB is stored. In the tag, 
not only the position identification but data for judging if 
encryption key data is present in the EKB is stored. The 
amount of data in the EKB is greatly reduced and the 
decoding by a device is simplified. Thus, providing an 
information processing system and method enabling 
reduction of the amount of data in an Effective key block 
(EKB) used for an encryption key structure of tree 
structure.
