International Classification => (71) 
Abstract => The present device of this invention for obtaining potable water from atmosphere comprises, A compressor (16) is provided for compressing a 
refrigerant.  A condenser (18) is provided for condensing the refrigerant received from the compressor (16).  An evaporator coil (14) is provided for receiving at 
one end thereof compressed refrigerant from the condenser (18) and being disposed in a water tank (12).  The evaporator (14) is operable for evaporating 
refrigerant and thereby cooling the potable water (13) in the water tank (12).  Drip coils (28) are provided for condensing the potable water from the ambient air 
with the cooled potable water (13) from the water tank passing through the drip coils (28) before returning to the water tank (12).  A fan (20) is provided for 
blowing ambient air about the drip coils (28) and the condenser (18).  A discharge device (44).  A filter (40) and ultra-violet light source (42) are provided for 
sterilizing the potable water (13) and a non-toxic coating is provided and disposed on the interior of the drip coil (28) and the exterior of the evaporator (14) 
with the non-toxic coating comprising 25 to 35 percent titanium oxide. 
 
This invention also relates to a method of obtaining potable water from atmospheric air by using the above device.
