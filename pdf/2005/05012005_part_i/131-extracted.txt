Title => OPTICAL CHANNEL WAVEGUIDE AMPLIFIER 
 

International Classification => H 01 S 3/063 (71) 
Abstract => An optical channel waveguide amplifier and fabrication 
process are provided for an optical communications 
system. The amplifier employs an optical waveguide 
having a core of active material exhibiting optical 
fluorescence when stimulated. The core has a 
propagation axis extending from an input surface to an 
output surface. The input surface intersects the 
propagation axis at a non-orthogonal angle (e.g, 45 DEG 
). A cladding at least partially surrounds the core, and a 
coating is provided over the angled input surface of the 
core. The coating is anti-reflective of the optical signal, 
input at a predetermined signal wavelength, and is 
highly reflective of the pump, input at a predetermined 
pump wavelength. A prism, index-matched to the core, 
is secured to the angled face of the optical waveguide so 
that the input signal may be focused into the core 
through the prism and the coating collinearly with the 
axis of propagation, while the pump is reflected into the 
core off the coating at the angled input surface from an 
angle to the axis of propagation. The optical signal 
undergoes amplification within the core by stimulated 
emissions of the active material driven by the pump.
