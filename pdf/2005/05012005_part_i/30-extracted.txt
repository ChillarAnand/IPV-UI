Abstract => The present invention provides for a processing system (3) and method of operating a photographic processor (5) which comprises 
monitoring an average consumption of water, chemistry, packaging material and energy per unit amount of photographic film processed in the 
processor. By taking into account the inter-relationship between all of the above-noted parameters, a fully-automated color film processor having a 
specified eco-efficiency property can be designed. The eco-efficiency property of the processor is characterized in that it provides more function for the 
processor with less environmental impacts than comparable products and combines attributes such as minimization of mass and a volume of solution 
that is heated by a processor, effective use of energy, simplification of power consumption, minimization of time required to process film, recovery of 
waste produced during operation of the processor, and recovery and reuse of water evaporated during use of the processor.
