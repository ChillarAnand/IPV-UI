(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a stable pyrithione salt polyol dispersion containing a pyrithione salt(s) in particulate form, a polyol 
and a stabilizer such as a rheological additive. The dispersion can be incorporated into existing polyurethane formulations without 
additional formula adjustment. Polyurethane foams produced from the composition containing pyrithione salt polyol dispersion of the 
present invention have more open cell structures, than those produced with a typical commercially available pyrithione salt thus 
providing a soft comfortable feeling.
