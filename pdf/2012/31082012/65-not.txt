(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a device for driving a shuttle (1, 1) that can be moved in the reed (17) of a circular loom along a circular orbit 
(16) without contact, comprising at least one permanent magnet (29, 29) on the shuttle (1, 1) and at least one magnet (22, 22) that is 
operatively connected to the at least one permanent magnet (29, 29) of the shuttle (1, 1) and that is arranged on a drive element (10) 
that can be moved concentrically to the orbit (16) of the shuttle, wherein an air gap (11) is formed between the shuttle (1, 1) and the 
drive element (10). The at least one permanent magnet (29, 29) of the shuttle (1, 1) and the at least one magnet (22, 22) of the drive 
element (10) are polarized in such a way that the at least one permanent magnet of the shuttle and the at least one magnet of the drive 
element mutually attract each other by means of magnetic forces and thus form a magnetic attraction section (14).
