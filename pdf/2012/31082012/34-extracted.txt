(57) Abstract : 
The present invention concerns chemical bath deposition equipment for depositing the thin films and method thereof. The deposition 
method implemented by the invented equipment is advantageous in that, the integrated embodiment bi-directional DC motor 
successfully optimizes the thermal field distribution and flow field distribution inside the chemical bath reaction fluid, which improves 
the quality of thin films synthesized. The multiple substrate design enhances the quantity, hence less consumption of experimental 
compound solutions. The reaction ambience inside the housing is well isolated from the outside atmosphere for creating the toxic free 
surrounding.
