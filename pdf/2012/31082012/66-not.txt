(57) Abstract : 
Impedance spectroscopy has been proposed as a method of monitoring mucosal injury due to hypoperfusion and ischemia in the 
critically ill. The invention includes an algorithm developed to calculate the characteristic electrical values that best describe human 
gastric impedance measurements and simplify the information obtained with this method. A database of gastric spectra was obtained 
from healthy volunteers, cardiovascular surgery and critically ill patients. The gastric spectrum forms two semi circles in the complex 
domain, divided into low frequency (F < 10 kHz) and high frequency (F > 10 kHz). A fitting algorithm was developed based on the 
Cole model, and central characteristic parameters were calculated. The parameters were validated using the normalized mean squared 
error and 0.7 % of the spectra were discarded. From the experimental data obtained in humans, the greatest changes observed as the 
gastric mucosa becomes ischemic occur at low frequencies, which are specific and sensitive to tissue damage, and vary with the 
degree of hypoperfusion.
