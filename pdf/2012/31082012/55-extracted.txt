(57) Abstract : 
The invention discloses isostatic-pressing (IP) applied to polymer (e.g., PTFE) coated razor blade edges to produce thin, dense, and 
uniform blade edges which in turn exhibit low initial cutting forces correlating with a more comfortable shaves. The isostatic press 
utilized may be a hot isostatic press (HIP) or cold isostatic press (CIP) or any other isostatic press process. The HIP conditions may 
include an environment of elevated temperatures and pressures in an inert atmosphere. The HIP conditions may be applied to non-
sintered coatings or sintered coatings or before or after a FlutecÂ® process is applied to coatings. CIP conditions may include room 
temperature and elevated pressure. The polymeric material may be a a non-fluofluoropolymer or ropolymer material or any composite 
thereof. It may be deposited initially by any method, including but not limited to, dipping, spin coating, sputtering, or thermal 
Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD).
