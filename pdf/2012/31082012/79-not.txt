(57) Abstract : 
A low-pressure pump (13) supplies oil stored in a steering case (32) to a steering device (4) as lubricating oil via a steering lubricating 
circuit (31). A high-pressure pump (14) supplies the oil stored in the steering case (32) to a clutch via a high-pressure circuit (33). A 
transmission lubricating circuit (34) branches off from the high-pressure circuit (33) via a relief valve (51) and supplies lubricating oil 
to a transmission device (3). A transmission-lubricating assist circuit (35) is provided so as to branch off from the steering lubricating 
circuit (31) and is connected to the transmission lubricating circuit (34). A transmission case (36) stores the oil used to lubricate the 
transmission device (3). A scavenging pump (15) returns the oil stored in the transmission case (36) to the steering device (4).
